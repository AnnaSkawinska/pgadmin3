pgAdmin III README
==================

Introduction
------------

pgAdmin III aims to replicate and improve the design of pgAdmin II, and 
support multiple platforms. After a long period of ongoing discussion, 
research and arguing, it was decided that the preferred development language
was C++, using the wxWindows (http://www.wxwidgets.org) framework.

Compilation
-----------

Unix:  Please see docs/en_US/unix_compilation.html for details of building
       pgAdmin III on unix platforms.

Win32: pgAdmin III can be compiled on Windows using MS Visual C++. We use 6.0
       with service pack 5. The project workspace file can be found in the 
       src directory.

Translation
-----------

Translation into your preferred language is easily possible even for 
non-programmers. Please see docs/en_US/translation_*.html for further details.
