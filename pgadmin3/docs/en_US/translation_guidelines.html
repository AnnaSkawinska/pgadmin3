<H3>Translation guidelines</H3>
<p>Traditionally, it is hard to translate
strings dealing with database technologies. We will first try to
outline the difficulties of translation, before proposing writing and
translating guidelines. If you are translating pgAdmin3, skip
directly to Translating guidelines at the bottom of the page. 
</p>
<H3>Translation problems</H3>
<p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is
based on the English language. SQL queries cannot be translated into
another language. For example, "SELECT * FROM table_foo WHERE
clause;" will not be translated. 
</p>
<p>Sometimes, the border between the SQL
language and the English language is not obvious, because SQL was
designed to be close as possible to natural language. For example,
there are three possible translations for "Create View"
into French, depending on the context: "Crer vue"
or "Create View" or "Crer Vue". 
</p>
<p>The difficulty for the user is to keep
in mind the correspondence between English and translated words. In
our example "View" is translated into "Vue",
which is an easy correspondence (called "translation pair"
afterwards). But with dozens of translation pairs like
"Trigger/Déclencheur", "Row/Ligne",
"Column/Colonne", you need to keep in mind many variations
and turn yourself into a translator, which was not the aim of the
translation. 
</p>
<p>In some languages, translation of SQL
keywords and database objects do not exist yet, because the community
of users is not large enough to define a language consensus. In such
cases, translators try to innovate, creating translated words which
enrich vocabulary but do not clarify the software interface. The
problem is that other translators may not be aware of the new
vocabulary, trying to impose their own translation choices. 
</p>
<p>As a result, translations lack
consistency, users have difficulties to find the corresponding SQL
keywords to write their queries and finally ... turn to the English
version of the software. 
</p>
<p>Also, we should keep in mind that
English has very few grammar rules compared to other European
languages, which have complex cases (feminine/neutral/masculine) and
derivation (nominative, accusative, dative, etc...). Non-European
languages sometimes do not have verbs, adjectives and others
aggregate nouns. This causes many translation problems when
programmers try to build sentences like "Create a new %s"
to handle cases like "Create a new View", "Create a
new Table", etc... Let's study this example in more detail: 
</p>
<UL>
	<li><p>"Create
	a new %s" is translated into French by "Crer
	nouveau/nouvelle %s" to handle feminine/masculine cases, which
	is not very obvious. In German, "%s" will not be replaced
	safely by a noun, because it must be derivated in accusative case.
	In several European languages, the replacement of "%s" by
	a noun may fail. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Some
	aggregative languages will not express the two words "new %s"
	separately but will join them, either writing "%snew" or
	"new%s" in a single noun, with derivation and cases.
	Hungarian is an example where "%s" constructions will
	sometimes fail. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Also, in non-European languages,
	adjectives like "new" or verbs like "create" may
	not exist and be expressed by a suffix or a prefix. In such cases,
	translating "Create a new %s" is simply impossible. 
	</p>
</UL>
<p>When you start translating pgAdmin3,
PhpPgAdmin3 or PostgreSQL into your mother tongue, you will soon
notice this kind of problem. The only solution is to define writing
and translation guidelines and to stick to them. 
</p>
<H3>Writing guidelines</H3>
<p>We propose a very simple solution
based on the idea that a developer/writer should always try to make a
clear difference between SQL keywords and natural language. If
possible, SQL keywords and database objects should be written in
capital letters. For example, "Create a new view" should be
written "Create a new VIEW". 
</p>
<p>Avoid the use of "%s" unless
the replaced sting is invariable, like it is the case for a product
name,a username, a password, etc... As such, "Successfully
connected to host: %s" and "User %s was disconnected"
are valid strings. 
</p>
<p>Never write a string like "Create
a new %s" for the reasons explained previously. You should write
"Create a new VIEW", "Create a new TABLE",
"Create a new INDEX", etc... 
</p>
<H3>Translating guidelines</H3>
<p>Never translate SQL keywords written
in upper-case letters for the reasons explained before. In some cases
you might even break pgAdmin3 if you do! 
</p>
<p>Stick as much as possible to words
which are close to the original SQL syntax. For example, in French,
you may use "vue" for "view", because both words
start with the letter "v". Do not choose distant words,
like "déclencheur" for "trigger", because
entry-level users may not be able to make a good use of the SQL
syntax ... and ultimately switch to the English version. Sometimes
it's better to simply leave these keywords untranslated, instead of
creating a fancy word nobody will recognize. 
</p>
<p>Please take special care about
including all %s and %d variable placeholders correctly. If you make
a typo error, the application might crash. On rare occasions, it
might be necessary to reorder placeholders. In the following
(fictive) example, both parameter positions are exchanged: "Server
%s user %s is logged in." could be translated by "L'utilisateur
%2$s est connect au serveur %1$s.". At the moment,
pgAdmin3 does not require any reorder placehorders, but it might
change in the future. Just be aware of it! 
</p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are denoted by a
leading "&". For example "&Add", which is
translated into French by "&Ajouter", can be triggered
from keyboard using Alt + A. Be careful when changing letters, to
avoid keyboard entry conflicts within one menu. If you deviate from
the original shortcut keys, pgAdmin3 users might have problems
remembering shortcuts in both English and translated pgAdmin3
versions. Therefore, be careful creating new shortcuts if you cannot
choose the same letter.</p>
<p>Menu strings also contain hard coded
shortcuts (Ctrl-X) or function keys (F5). These can be identified by
a preceding \t (tab). If appropriate, the modifier key name may be
translated (Ctrl-), but the key combination must remain the same in
any case, because the behaviour is coded in pgAdmin3 source.</p>
<p>Most forms are not designed with
resizing capabilities, because this is quite hard work. The only
resizing forms are the function, view and rule property windows.
Therefore, you may need to shrink the translated text to the English
size. In general, we tried to leave enough space for translation
texts, but if you believe there are certain places we should spend
more space please let us know.</p>
