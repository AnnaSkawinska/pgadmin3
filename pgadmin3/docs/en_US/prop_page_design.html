<H3>Property Page Design</H3>
<P>Design of dialogs should follow these rules as much as possible</P>
<LI>Standard dialog size is (220,240d)
<LI>Notebook is at 2,2d, size (216,216d)
<LI>Standard button size is (50,15d)
<LI>First control at (5,5d)
<LI>Standard controls are at (70,[y] d), size (135,12d)
<LI>Vertical constrol spacing is 15d, for radio buttons and checkboxes 12d
<LI>Static text has a vertical offset of 2 relative to other controls
<LI>Static text should be designed with 50 % space in reserve, to leave enough space for translated strings.

As a proposal, this are the sizes and positions I used so far in dlgUser 
and dlgDatabase:

- first control at (10, 10)
- Standard controls are at (100, y) size (200, 20)
- vertical control spacing 25, for radio buttons and checkboxes 20
- static text has a vertical offset of 3 relative to other controls
- standard Button size is (75, 25)
- controls including statics will need up to 50 % more room for under GTK2 if wxWidgets 2.4 is used; 2.5 is recommended.
- statics should be designed with 50 % space in reserve, to leave enough space for translated strings.

For dialogs derived from dlgSecurityProperty, the Security page will be 
created dynamically.
All dialogs will inherit the SQL page from dlgProperty.
