<H3>Connect to Server</H3>

<center><img src="images/server.png"></center>

<P>Use this dialog to add a new server connection to the root of the
pgAdmin tree.
</P>
<P>
If you're experiencing connection problems, check the <a href="connect-error.html">connection problems</a> page.
</P>
<P>
The address is the IP address of the machine to contact, or the full
qualified domain name. The description is a text to identify the
server in the pgAdmin tree.
</P>
<P>
The service field specifies parameters to control the database service
process. Its meaning is operating system dependent.
</P>
<P>
If pgAdmin is running on a Windows machine, it can control the
postmaster service if you have enough access rights. Enter the name of
the service. In case of a remote server, it must be prepended by the
machine name (e.g. PSE1\pgsql-8.0). pgAdmin will automatically
discover services running on your local machine.
<P>
If pgAdmin is running on a Unix machine, it can control processes
running on the local machine if you have enough access rights. Enter a
full path and needed options to access the pg_ctl program. When
executing service control functions, pgAdmin will append
status/start/stop keywords to this. Example:<BR>
sudo /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /data/pgsql
</P>
<P>If the password for that server is empty, you can unselect the "need password" option. When connecting
to the database, the password won't be required from you any more. For
security reasons, passwords are not stored by pgAdmin.</P>
<P>
This dialog can be launched at a later time to correct or add
parameters by executing "properties" when the server is selected.
