pgadmin3 (1.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

    cleaner: ${Source-Version} in depends fields of debian/control.

pgadmin3 (1.0.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * REALLY moved to policy version 3.6.1 instead of 3.6.0 (debian/control)
    as it was not corrected in previous version of the package...

    Used [pkgname].substvars to get rid of this

    so that users of old unofficial pgadmin3 package can upgrade "smoothly"

    in options box. Suppressed the line concerning systemfonts which fails to
    build as is.
  * Commented dh_installexamples in "indep" target so that the doc directory
    for pgadmin3-data is really a symlink to pgadmin3
  * Really removed ${misc:Depends} from debian/control as it was still there.

 -- Raphael Enrici <blacknoz@club-internet.fr>  Thu,  4 Mar 2004 23:23:27 +0000

pgadmin3 (1.0.2-0.12) unstable; urgency=low

    doc directory a symlink to pgadmin3
  * Inserted quotes for icon entry in menu file

    necessary and just causes dpkg-gencontrol to throw a warning

pgadmin3 (1.0.2-0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Kept Andreas Tille's idea to remove wxWidgets at the end of the build but
    invoked $(doPgA3Wx)-clean target instead of using "rm -r" on an hardcoded
    directory
  * Fixed a typo concerning locales installation in /usr/share/locale and added
    LC_MESSAGES directory to the install destination
  * Moved back "doc" files to /usr/share/pgadmin3/docs as they are required by
    pgadmin3 in order to run properly (debian-policy 12.3.)
  * Cleaned binary-indep / binary-arch build process so that packages are not
    generated twice. (Passed DH_OPTIONS=-i to indep and -a to arch).
  * Added patch from Andreas Pflug to wxWidgets to prevent pgAdmin3 help system
    crash (AP patch posted to wx patches as 854137)
  * Renamed pgadmin3-doc to pgadmin3-data as this is not a pure documentation
    package
  * Changed the way the install is done: install all in debian/tmp then use
    dh_install

    the complete license in debian/copyright.
  * Split into binary and doc package
  * Remove wxWidgets build directory at the end of the binary-arch target
    to save some disk space on the build machine (for those who forget to
    make clean after the build process ...)
