\f2\b0\fs22 \cf0 Preamble\
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\
Definitions:\

	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files \
	created through textual modification. \

\f2\fs22 "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not \
	been modified, or has been modified in accordance with \

\f3\fs26 \'b7	
\f2\fs22 "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing \
	this Package. \

\f3\fs26 \'b7	
\f2\fs22 "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on \
	the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of \
	people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to \
	justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the \
	computing community at large as a market that must \
	bear the fee.) \

\f3\fs26 \'b7	
\f2\fs22 "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the \
	item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling\
