<h3>Creating paths and listens</h3>

<A name="path"></a>
<H4>Create paths to other nodes</H4>

<p>
Slony-I needs path information, that defines how a slon process can communicate to
other nodes. The conninfo string takes a connect string as described in the
<a href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT'>libpq connection</A> documentation.
Usually, you will need to specify host, dbname and username, while the password should
be stored in the <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html'>.pgpass file</A>.
</p>

<p>
You must create a path to every other node, on each node. For example, in a two node cluster
you need to create a path to the slave on the master, and one to the master on the slave.
</p>

<A name="listen"></a>
<H4>Create listens to other nodes</H4>
<BR>

<p>
After the communication path has been defined, the slon processes need to be 
advised to listen to events from other nodes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note: </b>This step is not necessary for Slony-I v1.1
and later, because listen information is generated automatically when paths are defined.
