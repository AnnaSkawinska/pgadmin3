<h3>Creating paths and listens</h3>

<A name="path"></a>
<H4>Create paths to other nodes</H4>
<BR>

<p>
Slony-I needs path information, that defines how a slon process can communicate to
other nodes. The conninfo string takes a connect string as described in the
<a href='pg/libpq.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT'>libpq connection</A> documentation.
Usually, you will need to specify host, dbname and username, while the password should
be stored in the <a href='pg/libpq-pgpass.html'>.pgpass file</A>.
</p>

<A name="listen"></a>
<H4>Create listens to other nodes</H4>
<BR>
<center><img src="images/slony-listen.png"></center>
<p>
After the communication path has been defined, the slon processes need to be 
advised to listen to events from other nodes. This step is not necessary for Slony-I V1.1 
and later, because listen information is generated automatically when paths are defined.
