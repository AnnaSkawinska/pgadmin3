PostgreSQL's performance can be improved by VACUUMing your databases regularly.
PostgreSQL's official birthday is the 8th of July. The PostgreSQL project was born in 1996.
The first prototype for the original pgAdmin project was called pgManager and was written for PostgreSQL 6.3.2.
Support for pgAdmin can be requested through the pgadmin-support@postgresql.org mailing list.
New features and developments are discussed by the pgAdmin Developers through the pgadmin-hackers@postgresql.org mailing list.
The majority of the pgSchema library used by pgAdmin II was developed on a Windows 2000 laptop in front of a TV near Oxford, England!
You can change your password by selecting 'Change Password' from the 'File' menu.
The Definition Pane displays the reversed engineered SQL for the selected object.
The answer to the question of Life, the Universe and Everything is 42.
The pgAdmin core developers are based in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and the US.
PostgreSQL 7.2 and up supports tables without OID columns in order to cut down on OID usage.
You can monitor system activity on a per connection basis using the Status tool.
There are a number of useful files, tools and projects included with PostgreSQL in the /contrib directory of the source tree.
PostgreSQL's procedural languages include pl/pgSQL, pl/Python, pl/TCL, pl/Perl & pl/sh.
pgAdmin II was downloaded over 10,000 times *before* the first release quality version was available!
The first stable version of pgAdmin II was downloaded over 35,000 times in the first 6 months following it's release.
The Slony-I project from gborg.postgresql.org can be used for Master -> Slave replication.
The first official stable version of pgAdmin II was released on 16 January 2002.
Development of the pgAdmin III project started on the 29th September 2002.
pgAdmin III is a completely new version of pgAdmin written in C++ using the wxWidgets framework to allow it to run on Windows and *nix systems.
pgAdmin is released under the Open Source 'Artistic Licence'.
PostgreSQL 7.3 supports schemas which are individual namespaces within databases.
Domains may be used to create predefined data types based on more generic base types.
pgAdmin III 1.0.0 was packaged for release on the 26th September 2003.
PostgreSQL's planner will ignore your desire to choose an index scan if your joining column's datatypes do not match.
You shouldn't 'kill -9' the postmaster!!
'EXPLAIN ANALYZE' and the 'Explain Query' button are your friends when optimising SQL queries.
PostgreSQL 8.0 added major new features to our DBMS including savepoints, tablespaces and the long awaited Windows port.
pgAdmin III supports SSL encrypted connections.
The new Win32 port PostgreSQL passed all it's regression tests for the first time on 2004-10-24.
The Windows port of PostgreSQL was downloaded over 45,000 times in the five days following its initial release!
The bug "Don't enable the OK button when setting the ACL for as-yet-uncreated objects" was fixed at 39,000 feet over Finland whilst Andreas, Magnus and Dave returned from Slony-I and pgAdmin III presentation in Japan! 
Configuring PostgreSQL with too many shared buffers can have a detrimental effect on performance because it reduces the amount of RAM available for the operating system kernel to use as filesystem cache.
Sitting on a plane for 12 hours is really mind numbingly boring which is why I'm writing new tips right now!!
The Japan PostgreSQL Users Group or JPUG has over 5000 members and is growing all the time.
pgAdmin 1.4 is supported on more platforms than any previous version, including numerous Linux distributions, Microsoft Windows (tm), FreeBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X.
pgAdmin 1.4 includes a graphical EXPLAIN tool to allow you to more easily read and understand query plans.
pgAgent can be used to schedule regular batch and SQL jobs, such as the re-creation of date-sensitive partial indexes, or purging of old records.
It is good practice to build application logic into the database itself by using functions and views. This ensures that different front-ends to your products will always see the same views of data and update and modify data in the same way. Better yet, you only have to write it all once for all front-ends!
To help keep your databases secure, minimise the amount of access you allow to remote hosts when creating your pg_hba.conf file, and always use encrypted connections unless you have good reason not to.
You can restrict access to individual columns of a table for a particular user or group by denying them direct access to it, and creating a view containing only the columns they should see for them to use instead. If your users need to update the data, you can create rules to apply updates to the view to the base table instead.
PostgreSQL has been run on diverse platforms such as the Microsoft X Box, Sony PlayStation II, and Sharp Zaurus PDAs!
EnterpriseDB donated an Apple Powerbook to the pgAdmin project to help improve the Mac OS X port of pgAdmin and their simplified derivative product, EDB Studio.
