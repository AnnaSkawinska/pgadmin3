<a name="id577972"></a><p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> provides various lock modes
    to control concurrent access to data in tables.  These modes can
    be used for application-controlled locking in situations where
    <span class="acronym">MVCC</span> does not give the desired behavior.  Also,
    most <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> commands automatically
    acquire locks of appropriate modes to ensure that referenced
    tables are not dropped or modified in incompatible ways while the
    command executes.  (For example, <code class="command">ALTER TABLE</code> cannot be
    executed concurrently with other operations on the same table.)
   </p>
<p>    To examine a list of the currently outstanding locks in a database
    server, use the <code class="structname">pg_locks</code> system view
    (<a href="view-pg-locks.html" title="42.37. pg_locks">Section 42.37, &#8220;<code class="structname">pg_locks</code>&#8221;</a>). For more
    information on monitoring the status of the lock manager
    subsystem, refer to <a href="monitoring.html" title="Chapter 24. Monitoring Database Activity">Chapter 24, <i>Monitoring Database Activity</i></a>.

<a name="id578049"></a><p>    The list below shows the available lock modes and the contexts in
    which they are used automatically by
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.  You can also acquire any
    of these locks explicitly with the command <a href="sql-lock.html">LOCK</a>.
    Remember that all of these lock modes are table-level locks,
    even if the name contains the word
    &#8220;<span class="quote">row</span>&#8221;; the names of the lock modes are historical.
    To some extent the names reflect the typical usage of each lock
    mode [mdash ] but the semantics are all the same.  The only real difference
    between one lock mode and another is the set of lock modes with
    which each conflicts.  Two transactions cannot hold locks of conflicting
    modes on the same table at the same time.  (However, a transaction
    never conflicts with itself.  For example, it may acquire
    <code class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock and later acquire
    <code class="literal">ACCESS SHARE</code> lock on the same table.)  Non-conflicting
    lock modes may be held concurrently by many transactions.  Notice in
    particular that some lock modes are self-conflicting (for example,
    an <code class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock cannot be held by more than one
    transaction at a time) while others are not self-conflicting (for example,
    an <code class="literal">ACCESS SHARE</code> lock can be held by multiple transactions).
    Once acquired, a lock is held till end of transaction.

<p>       Only an <code class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock blocks a

<a name="locking-rows"></a>12.3.2. Row-Level Locks</h3></div></div></div>
<p>     In addition to table-level locks, there are row-level locks, which
     can be exclusive or shared locks.  An exclusive row-level lock on a
     specific row is automatically acquired when the row is updated or
     deleted.  The lock is held until the transaction commits or rolls
     back.  Row-level locks do not affect data querying; they block
     <span class="emphasis"><em>writers to the same row</em></span> only.
    </p>
<p>     To acquire an exclusive row-level lock on a row without actually
     modifying the row, select the row with <code class="command">SELECT FOR
     UPDATE</code>.  Note that once the row-level lock is acquired,
     the transaction may update the row multiple times without
     fear of conflicts.
    </p>
<p>     To acquire a shared row-level lock on a row, select the row with
     <code class="command">SELECT FOR SHARE</code>.  A shared lock does not prevent
     other transactions from acquiring the same shared lock.  However,
     no transaction is allowed to update, delete, or exclusively lock a
     row on which any other transaction holds a shared lock.  Any attempt
     to do so will block until the shared locks have been released.
    </p>
<p>     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> doesn't remember any
     information about modified rows in memory, so it has no limit to
     the number of rows locked at one time.  However, locking a row
     may cause a disk write; thus, for example, <code class="command">SELECT FOR
     UPDATE</code> will modify selected rows to mark them locked, and so
     will result in disk writes.
    </p>
<p>     In addition to table and row locks, page-level share/exclusive locks are
     used to control read/write access to table pages in the shared buffer
     pool.  These locks are released immediately after a row is fetched or
     updated.  Application developers normally need not be concerned with
     page-level locks, but we mention them for completeness.

<a name="locking-deadlocks"></a>12.3.3. Deadlocks</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id578803"></a><p>     The use of explicit locking can increase the likelihood of
     <em class="firstterm">deadlocks</em>, wherein two (or more) transactions each
     hold locks that the other wants.  For example, if transaction 1
     acquires an exclusive lock on table A and then tries to acquire
     an exclusive lock on table B, while transaction 2 has already
     exclusive-locked table B and now wants an exclusive lock on table
     A, then neither one can proceed.
     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> automatically detects
     deadlock situations and resolves them by aborting one of the
     transactions involved, allowing the other(s) to complete.
     (Exactly which transaction will be aborted is difficult to
     predict and should not be relied on.)
    </p>
<p>     Note that deadlocks can also occur as the result of row-level
     locks (and thus, they can occur even if explicit locking is not
     used). Consider the case in which there are two concurrent
     transactions modifying a table. The first transaction executes:

</p>
<pre class="screen">UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 11111;</pre>
<p>

     This acquires a row-level lock on the row with the specified
     account number. Then, the second transaction executes:

</p>
<pre class="screen">UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 22222;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 11111;</pre>
<p>

     The first <code class="command">UPDATE</code> statement successfully
     acquires a row-level lock on the specified row, so it succeeds in
     updating that row. However, the second <code class="command">UPDATE</code>
     statement finds that the row it is attempting to update has
     already been locked, so it waits for the transaction that
     acquired the lock to complete. Transaction two is now waiting on
     transaction one to complete before it continues execution. Now,
     transaction one executes:

</p>
<pre class="screen">UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 22222;</pre>
<p>

     Transaction one attempts to acquire a row-level lock on the
     specified row, but it cannot: transaction two already holds such
     a lock. So it waits for transaction two to complete. Thus,
     transaction one is blocked on transaction two, and transaction
     two is blocked on transaction one: a deadlock
     condition. <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> will detect this
     situation and abort one of the transactions.
    </p>
<p>     The best defense against deadlocks is generally to avoid them by
     being certain that all applications using a database acquire
     locks on multiple objects in a consistent order. In the example
     above, if both transactions
     had updated the rows in the same order, no deadlock would have
     occurred. One should also ensure that the first lock acquired on
     an object in a transaction is the highest mode that will be
     needed for that object.  If it is not feasible to verify this in
     advance, then deadlocks may be handled on-the-fly by retrying
     transactions that are aborted due to deadlock.
    </p>
<p>     So long as no deadlock situation is detected, a transaction seeking
     either a table-level or row-level lock will wait indefinitely for
     conflicting locks to be released.  This means it is a bad idea for
     applications to hold transactions open for long periods of time
     (e.g., while waiting for user input).
