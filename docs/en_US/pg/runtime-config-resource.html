        however, settings significantly higher than the minimum are

        Note that for a complex query, several sort or hash operations might be

        a time by a database session, and an installation normally doesn't
        have very many of them happening concurrently, it's safe to set this
        value significantly larger than <code class="varname">work_mem</code>.  Larger

<dd><p>        Specifies the maximum safe depth of the server's execution stack.
        The ideal setting for this parameter is the actual stack size limit
        enforced by the kernel (as set by <code class="literal">ulimit -s</code> or local
        equivalent), less a safety margin of a megabyte or so.  The safety
        margin is needed because the stack depth is not checked in every
        routine in the server, but only in key potentially-recursive routines
        such as expression evaluation.  Setting the parameter higher than
        the actual kernel limit will mean that a runaway recursive function
        can crash an individual backend process.  The default setting is
        2048 KB (two megabytes), which is conservatively small and unlikely
        to risk crashes.  However, it may be too small to allow execution
        of complex functions.

<p>        <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> procedural language

<p>        By preloading a shared library (and initializing it if

<a name="runtime-config-resource-vacuum-cost"></a>17.4.4.        Cost-Based Vacuum Delay
     </h3></div></div></div>
<p>      During the execution of <a href="sql-vacuum.html" title="VACUUM">VACUUM</a> and <a href="sql-analyze.html" title="ANALYZE">ANALYZE</a> commands, the system maintains an
      internal counter that keeps track of the estimated cost of the
      various I/O operations that are performed.  When the accumulated
      cost reaches a limit (specified by
      <code class="varname">vacuum_cost_limit</code>), the process performing
      the operation will sleep for a while (specified by
      <code class="varname">vacuum_cost_delay</code>). Then it will reset the
      counter and continue execution.
     </p>
<p>      The intent of this feature is to allow administrators to reduce
      the I/O impact of these commands on concurrent database
      activity. There are many situations in which it is not very
      important that maintenance commands like
      <code class="command">VACUUM</code> and <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> finish
      quickly; however, it is usually very important that these
      commands do not significantly interfere with the ability of the
      system to perform other database operations. Cost-based vacuum
      delay provides a way for administrators to achieve this.
     </p>

<a name="runtime-config-resource-background-writer"></a>17.4.5. Background Writer</h3></div></div></div>
<p>      Beginning in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.0, there is a separate server
      process called the <em class="firstterm">background writer</em>, whose sole function
      is to issue writes of &#8220;<span class="quote">dirty</span>&#8221; shared buffers.  The intent is
      that server processes handling user queries should seldom or never have
      to wait for a write to occur, because the background writer will do it.
      This arrangement also reduces the performance penalty associated with
      checkpoints.  The background writer will continuously trickle out dirty
      pages to disk, so that only a few pages will need to be forced out when
      checkpoint time arrives, instead of the storm of dirty-buffer writes that
      formerly occurred at each checkpoint.  However there is a net overall
      increase in I/O load, because where a repeatedly-dirtied page might
      before have been written only once per checkpoint interval, the
      background writer might write it several times in the same interval.
      In most situations a continuous low load is preferable to periodic
      spikes, but the parameters discussed in this subsection can be used to tune
      the behavior for local needs.

<dd><p>         In each round, no more than this many buffers will be written
         as a result of the scan of the entire buffer pool.  (If this
         limit is reached, the scan stops, and resumes at the next buffer
         during the next round.)
         The default value is 5.
         This option can be set at server start or in the
         <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> file.
        </p></dd>

<p>      Smaller values of <code class="varname">bgwriter_all_percent</code> and
      <code class="varname">bgwriter_all_maxpages</code> reduce the extra I/O load
      caused by the background writer, but leave more work to be done
      at checkpoint time.  To reduce load spikes at checkpoints,
      increase these two values.
      Similarly, smaller values of <code class="varname">bgwriter_lru_percent</code> and
      <code class="varname">bgwriter_lru_maxpages</code> reduce the extra I/O load
      caused by the background writer, but make it more likely that server
      processes will have to issue writes for themselves, delaying interactive
      queries.
      To disable background writing entirely,
      set both <code class="varname">maxpages</code> values and/or both
      <code class="varname">percent</code> values to zero.
