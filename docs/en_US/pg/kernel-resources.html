<p>   A large <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> installation can quickly exhaust
   various operating system resource limits. (On some systems, the
   factory defaults are so low that you don't even need a really
   &#8220;<span class="quote">large</span>&#8221; installation.) If you have encountered this kind of
   problem, keep reading.

<a name="id2589973"></a><a name="id2589981"></a><p>    Shared memory and semaphores are collectively referred to as
    &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="systemitem">System V</span>
    <span class="acronym">IPC</span></span>&#8221; (together with message queues, which are not
    relevant for <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>). Almost all modern
    operating systems provide these features, but not all of them have
    them turned on or sufficiently sized by default, especially systems
    with BSD heritage. (For the <span class="systemitem">QNX</span> and
    <span class="systemitem">BeOS</span> ports, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    provides its own replacement implementation of these facilities.)
   </p>
<p>    The complete lack of these facilities is usually manifested by an
    <span class="errorname">Illegal system call</span> error upon server start. In
    that case there's nothing left to do but to reconfigure your
    kernel.  <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> won't work without them.
   </p>
<p>    When <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> exceeds one of the various hard
    <span class="acronym">IPC</span> limits, the server will refuse to start and
    should leave an instructive error message describing the problem
    encountered and what to do about it. (See also <a href="postmaster-start.html#postmaster-start-failures" title="16.3.1. Server Start-up Failures">Section 16.3.1, &#8220;Server Start-up Failures&#8221;</a>.) The relevant kernel
    parameters are named consistently across different systems; <a href="kernel-resources.html#sysvipc-parameters" title="Table 16.2. System V IPC parameters">Table 16.2, &#8220;System V IPC parameters&#8221;</a> gives an overview. The methods to set
    them, however, vary. Suggestions for some platforms are given below.
    Be warned that it is often necessary to reboot your machine, and
    possibly even recompile the kernel, to change these settings.

<p>    <a name="id2590261"></a> The most important
    shared memory parameter is <tt class="varname">SHMMAX</tt>, the maximum size, in
    bytes, of a shared memory segment. If you get an error message from
    <tt class="function">shmget</tt> like <span class="errorname">Invalid argument</span>, it is
    likely that this limit has been exceeded. The size of the required
    shared memory segment varies both with the number of requested
    buffers (<tt class="option">-B</tt> option) and the number of allowed connections
    (<tt class="option">-N</tt> option), although the former is the most significant.
    (You can, as a temporary solution, lower these settings to eliminate
    the failure.) As a rough approximation, you can estimate the
    required segment size as suggested in <a href="kernel-resources.html#sysvipc-parameters" title="Table 16.2. System V IPC parameters">Table 16.2, &#8220;System V IPC parameters&#8221;</a>.  Any error message you might get will
    contain the size of the failed allocation request.
   </p>
<p>    Some systems also have a limit on the total amount of shared memory in
    the system (<tt class="varname">SHMALL</tt>).  Make sure this is large enough
    for <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> plus any other applications that
    are using shared memory segments.  (Caution: <tt class="varname">SHMALL</tt>
    is measured in pages rather than bytes on many systems.)
   </p>
<p>    Less likely to cause problems is the minimum size for shared
    memory segments (<tt class="varname">SHMMIN</tt>), which should be at most
    approximately 256 kB for <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> (it is
    usually just 1). The maximum number of segments system-wide
    (<tt class="varname">SHMMNI</tt>) or per-process (<tt class="varname">SHMSEG</tt>) are unlikely
    to cause a problem unless your system has them set to zero.
   </p>
<p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> uses one semaphore per allowed connection
    (<tt class="option">-N</tt> option), in sets of 16.  Each such set will also
    contain a 17th semaphore which contains a &#8220;<span class="quote">magic
    number</span>&#8221;, to detect collision with semaphore sets used by
    other applications. The maximum number of semaphores in the system
    is set by <tt class="varname">SEMMNS</tt>, which consequently must be at least
    as high as <tt class="varname">max_connections</tt> plus one extra for each 16
    allowed connections (see the formula in <a href="kernel-resources.html#sysvipc-parameters" title="Table 16.2. System V IPC parameters">Table 16.2, &#8220;System V IPC parameters&#8221;</a>).  The parameter <tt class="varname">SEMMNI</tt>
    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <tt class="literal">ceil(max_connections / 16)</tt>. Lowering the number
    of allowed connections is a temporary workaround for failures,
    which are usually confusingly worded <span class="errorname">No space
    left on device</span>, from the function <tt class="function">semget</tt>.
   </p>
<p>    In some cases it might also be necessary to increase
    <tt class="varname">SEMMAP</tt> to be at least on the order of
    <tt class="varname">SEMMNS</tt>. This parameter defines the size of the semaphore
    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.
   </p>
<p>    The <tt class="varname">SEMMSL</tt> parameter, which determines how many
    semaphores can be in a set, must be at least 17 for
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
   </p>
<p>    Various other settings related to &#8220;<span class="quote">semaphore undo</span>&#8221;, such as
    <tt class="varname">SEMMNU</tt> and <tt class="varname">SEMUME</tt>, are not of concern
    for <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.

<p><b>Shared Memory. </b>         By default, only 4 MB of shared memory is supported. Keep in
         mind that shared memory is not pageable; it is locked in RAM.
         To increase the amount of shared memory supported by your
         system, add something like the following to your kernel configuration
         file:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">options "SHMALL=8192"
options "SHMMAX=\(SHMALL*PAGE_SIZE\)"</pre>
<p>
         <tt class="varname">SHMALL</tt> is measured in 4KB pages, so a value of
         1024 represents 4 MB of shared memory. Therefore the above increases
         the maximum shared memory area to 32 MB.
         For those running 4.3 or later, you will probably also need to increase
         <tt class="varname">KERNEL_VIRTUAL_MB</tt> above the default <tt class="literal">248</tt>.
         Once all changes have been made, recompile the kernel, and reboot.
        </p>
<p>        For those running 4.0 and earlier releases, use <tt class="command">bpatch</tt>
        to find the <tt class="varname">sysptsize</tt> value in the current
        kernel. This is computed dynamically at boot time.
</p>
<pre class="screen">$ <b class="userinput"><tt>bpatch -r sysptsize</tt></b>
<tt class="computeroutput">0x9 = 9</tt></pre>
<p>
        Next, add <tt class="varname">SYSPTSIZE</tt> as a hard-coded value in the
        kernel configuration file. Increase the value you found using
        <tt class="command">bpatch</tt>. Add 1 for every additional 4 MB of
        shared memory you desire.
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">options "SYSPTSIZE=16"</pre>
<p>
        <tt class="varname">sysptsize</tt> cannot be changed by <tt class="command">sysctl</tt>.
       </p>
<p><b>Semaphores. </b>         You will probably want to increase the number of semaphores
         as well; the default system total of 60 will only allow about
         50 <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> connections.  Set the
         values you want in your kernel configuration file, e.g.:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">options "SEMMNI=40"
options "SEMMNS=240"</pre>
<p>
        </p>

<p>        The options <tt class="varname">SYSVSHM</tt> and <tt class="varname">SYSVSEM</tt> need
        to be enabled when the kernel is compiled. (They are by
        default.) The maximum size of shared memory is determined by
        the option <tt class="varname">SHMMAXPGS</tt> (in pages). The following
        shows an example of how to set the various parameters:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">options         SYSVSHM
options         SHMMAXPGS=4096
options         SHMSEG=256

options         SYSVSEM
options         SEMMNI=256
options         SEMMNS=512
options         SEMMNU=256
options         SEMMAP=256</pre>
<p>
        (On <span class="systemitem">NetBSD</span> and <span class="systemitem">OpenBSD</span> the key word is actually
        <tt class="literal">option</tt> singular.)
       </p>
<p>        You might also want to configure your kernel to lock shared
        memory into RAM and prevent it from being paged out to swap.
        Use the <tt class="command">sysctl</tt> setting
        <tt class="literal">kern.ipc.shm_use_phys</tt>.
       </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="systemitem">HP-UX</span></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>        The default settings tend to suffice for normal installations.
        On <span class="productname">HP-UX</span> 10, the factory default for
        <tt class="varname">SEMMNS</tt> is 128, which might be too low for larger
        database sites.
       </p>
<p>        <span class="acronym">IPC</span> parameters can be set in the <span class="application">System
        Administration Manager</span> (<span class="acronym">SAM</span>) under
        <span class="guimenu">Kernel
        Configuration</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">Configurable Parameters</span>. Hit

<p>        The default shared memory limit (both
        <tt class="varname">SHMMAX</tt> and <tt class="varname">SHMALL</tt>) is 32
        MB in 2.2 kernels, but it can be changed in the
        <tt class="filename">proc</tt> file system (without reboot).  For
        example, to allow 128 MB:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><tt class="prompt">$</tt> <b class="userinput"><tt>echo 134217728 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/shmall</tt></b>
<tt class="prompt">$</tt> <b class="userinput"><tt>echo 134217728 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</tt></b></pre>
<p>
        You could put these commands into a script run at boot-time.
       </p>
<p>        Alternatively, you can use <tt class="command">sysctl</tt>, if
        available, to control these parameters.  Look for a file
        called <tt class="filename">/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> and add lines
        like the following to it:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">kernel.shmall = 134217728
kernel.shmmax = 134217728</pre>
<p>
        This file is usually processed at boot time, but
        <tt class="command">sysctl</tt> can also be called
        explicitly later.
       </p>
<p>        Other parameters are sufficiently sized for any application. If
        you want to see for yourself look in
        <tt class="filename">/usr/src/linux/include/asm-<i class="replaceable"><tt>xxx</tt></i>/shmparam.h</tt>
        and <tt class="filename">/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sem.h</tt>.

<p>        In OS X 10.2 and earlier, edit the file
        <tt class="filename">/System/Library/StartupItems/SystemTuning/SystemTuning</tt>
        and change the values in the following commands:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax
sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmin
sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmni
sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmseg

<p>
        In OS X 10.3, these commands have been moved to <tt class="filename">/etc/rc</tt>
        and must be edited there.  You'll need to reboot to make changes
        take effect.  Note that <tt class="filename">/etc/rc</tt> is usually
        overwritten by OS X updates (such as 10.3.6 to 10.3.7) so you
        should expect to have to redo your editing after each update.

<p> It may, however, be necessary to modify the global

<a name="id2591238"></a>16.5.2. Resource Limits</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>    Unix-like operating systems enforce various kinds of resource limits
    that might interfere with the operation of your
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server. Of particular
    importance are limits on the number of processes per user, the
    number of open files per process, and the amount of memory available
    to each process. Each of these have a &#8220;<span class="quote">hard</span>&#8221; and a
    &#8220;<span class="quote">soft</span>&#8221; limit. The soft limit is what actually counts
    but it can be changed by the user up to the hard limit. The hard
    limit can only be changed by the root user. The system call
    <tt class="function">setrlimit</tt> is responsible for setting these
    parameters. The shell's built-in command <tt class="command">ulimit</tt>
    (Bourne shells) or <tt class="command">limit</tt> (<span class="application">csh</span>) is
    used to control the resource limits from the command line. On
    BSD-derived systems the file <tt class="filename">/etc/login.conf</tt>
    controls the various resource limits set during login. See the
    operating system documentation for details. The relevant
    parameters are <tt class="varname">maxproc</tt>,
    <tt class="varname">openfiles</tt>, and <tt class="varname">datasize</tt>. For
    example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">default:\
...
        :datasize-cur=256M:\
        :maxproc-cur=256:\
        :openfiles-cur=256:\
...</pre>
<p>
    (<tt class="literal">-cur</tt> is the soft limit.  Append
    <tt class="literal">-max</tt> to set the hard limit.)
   </p>
<p>    Kernels can also have system-wide limits on some resources.
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>      On <span class="productname">Linux</span>
      <tt class="filename">/proc/sys/fs/file-max</tt> determines the
      maximum number of open files that the kernel will support.  It can
      be changed by writing a different number into the file or by
      adding an assignment in <tt class="filename">/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>.
      The maximum limit of files per process is fixed at the time the
      kernel is compiled; see
      <tt class="filename">/usr/src/linux/Documentation/proc.txt</tt> for
      more information.
      </p></li></ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    The <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server uses one process
    per connection so you should provide for at least as many processes
    as allowed connections, in addition to what you need for the rest
    of your system.  This is usually not a problem but if you run
    several servers on one machine things might get tight.
   </p>
<p>    The factory default limit on open files is often set to
    &#8220;<span class="quote">socially friendly</span>&#8221; values that allow many users to
    coexist on a machine without using an inappropriate fraction of
    the system resources.  If you run many servers on a machine this
    is perhaps what you want, but on dedicated servers you may want to
    raise this limit.
   </p>
<p>    On the other side of the coin, some systems allow individual
    processes to open large numbers of files; if more than a few
    processes do so then the system-wide limit can easily be exceeded.
    If you find this happening, and you do not want to alter the
    system-wide limit, you can set <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s <a href="runtime-config.html#guc-max-files-per-process">max_files_per_process</a> configuration parameter to
    limit the consumption of open files.

<a name="id2591418"></a>16.5.3. Linux Memory Overcommit</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>    In Linux 2.4 and later, the default virtual memory behavior is not
    optimal for <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>. Because of the
    way that the kernel implements memory overcommit, the kernel may
    terminate the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server (the
    <tt class="filename">postmaster</tt> process) if the memory demands of
    another process cause the system to run out of virtual memory.
   </p>
<p>    If this happens, you will see a kernel message that looks like
    this (consult your system documentation and configuration on where
    to look for such a message):
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">Out of Memory: Killed process 12345 (postmaster). </pre>
<p>
    This indicates that the <tt class="filename">postmaster</tt> process
    has been terminated due to memory pressure.
    Although existing database connections will continue to function
    normally, no new connections will be accepted.  To recover,
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> will need to be restarted.
   </p>
<p>    One way to avoid this problem is to run
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    on a machine where you can be sure that other processes will not
    run the machine out of memory.
   </p>
<p>    On Linux 2.6 and later, a better solution is to modify the kernel's
    behavior so that it will not &#8220;<span class="quote">overcommit</span>&#8221; memory.  This is
    done by selecting strict overcommit mode via <tt class="command">sysctl</tt>:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=2</pre>
<p>
    or placing an equivalent entry in <tt class="filename">/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>.
    You may also wish to modify the related setting 
    <tt class="literal">vm.overcommit_ratio</tt>.  For details see the kernel documentation
    file <tt class="filename">Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting</tt>.
   </p>
<p>    Some vendors' Linux 2.4 kernels are reported to have early versions
    of the 2.6 overcommit <tt class="command">sysctl</tt> parameter.  However, setting
    <tt class="literal">vm.overcommit_memory</tt> to 2
    on a kernel that does not have the relevant code will make
    things worse not better.  It is recommended that you inspect
    the actual kernel source code (see the function
    <tt class="function">vm_enough_memory</tt> in the file <tt class="filename">mm/mmap.c</tt>)
    to verify what is supported in your copy before you try this in a 2.4
    installation.  The presence of the <tt class="filename">overcommit-accounting</tt>
    documentation file should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be taken as evidence that the
    feature is there.  If in any doubt, consult a kernel expert or your
    kernel vendor.
