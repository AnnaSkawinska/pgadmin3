    (<VAR

    (You can, as a temporary solution, lower these settings to eliminate
    the failure.) As a rough approximation, you can estimate the
    required segment size by multiplying the number of buffers and the
    block size (8 kB by default) plus ample overhead (at least half a
    megabyte). Any error message you might get will contain the size of
    the failed allocation request.

    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore

    should be.

></H2
><P
>    Unix-like operating systems enforce various kinds of resource limits
    that might interfere with the operation of your
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server. Of particular
    importance are limits on the number of processes per user, the
    number of open files per process, and the amount of memory available
    to each process. Each of these have a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"hard"</SPAN
> and a
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"soft"</SPAN
> limit. The soft limit is what actually counts
    but it can be changed by the user up to the hard limit. The hard
    limit can only be changed by the root user. The system call
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>setrlimit</CODE
> is responsible for setting these
    parameters. The shell's built-in command <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ulimit</TT
>
    (Bourne shells) or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>limit</TT
> (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>csh</SPAN
>) is
    used to control the resource limits from the command line. On
    BSD-derived systems the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/login.conf</TT
>
    controls the various resource limits set during login. See the
    operating system documentation for details. The relevant
    parameters are <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>maxproc</VAR
>,
    <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>openfiles</VAR
>, and <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>datasize</VAR
>. For
    example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>default:\
...
        :datasize-cur=256M:\
        :maxproc-cur=256:\
        :openfiles-cur=256:\
...</PRE
><P>
    (<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-cur</VAR
> is the soft limit.  Append
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-max</VAR
> to set the hard limit.)
   </P
><P
>    Kernels can also have system-wide limits on some resources.

      <TT

>    The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    per connection so you should provide for at least as many processes
    as allowed connections, in addition to what you need for the rest
    of your system.  This is usually not a problem but if you run
    several servers on one machine things might get tight.
   </P
><P
>    The factory default limit on open files is often set to
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"socially friendly"</SPAN
> values that allow many users to
    coexist on a machine without using an inappropriate fraction of
    the system resources.  If you run many servers on a machine this
    is perhaps what you want, but on dedicated servers you may want to
    raise this limit.
   </P
><P
>    On the other side of the coin, some systems allow individual
    processes to open large numbers of files; if more than a few
    processes do so then the system-wide limit can easily be exceeded.
    If you find this happening, and you do not want to alter the system-wide
    limit, you can set <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_files_per_process</VAR

    limit the consumption of open files.
