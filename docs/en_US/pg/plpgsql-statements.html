<p>    In this section and the following ones, we describe all the statement
    types that are explicitly understood by
    <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>.
    Anything not recognized as one of these statement types is presumed
    to be an SQL command and is sent to the main database engine to execute
    (after substitution of any <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span> variables
    used in the statement).  Thus,
    for example, the SQL commands <tt class="command">INSERT</tt>, <tt class="command">UPDATE</tt>, and
    <tt class="command">DELETE</tt> may be considered to be statements of
    <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>, but they are not specifically
    listed here.

<a name="plpgsql-statements-assignment"></a>35.6.1. Assignment</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>     An assignment of a value to a variable or row/record field is
     written as:
</p>
<pre class="synopsis"><i class="replaceable"><tt>identifier</tt></i> := <i class="replaceable"><tt>expression</tt></i>;</pre>
<p>
     As explained above, the expression in such a statement is evaluated
     by means of an SQL <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> command sent to the main
     database engine.  The expression must yield a single value.
    </p>
<p>     If the expression's result data type doesn't match the variable's
     data type, or the variable has a specific size/precision
     (like <tt class="type">char(20)</tt>), the result value will be implicitly
     converted by the <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span> interpreter using
     the result type's output-function and 
     the variable type's input-function. Note that this could potentially
     result in run-time errors generated by the input function, if the
     string form of the result value is not acceptable to the input function.
    </p>
<p>     Examples:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">user_id := 20;
tax := subtotal * 0.06;</pre>

<a name="plpgsql-select-into"></a>35.6.2. <tt class="command">SELECT INTO</tt></h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<a name="id2648809"></a><p>     The result of a <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> command yielding multiple columns (but
     only one row) can be assigned to a record variable, row-type
     variable, or list of scalar variables.  This is done by:

</p>
<pre class="synopsis">SELECT INTO <i class="replaceable"><tt>target</tt></i> <i class="replaceable"><tt>select_expressions</tt></i> FROM ...;</pre>
<p>

     where <i class="replaceable"><tt>target</tt></i> can be a record variable, a row
     variable, or a comma-separated list of simple variables and
     record/row fields.  The <i class="replaceable"><tt>select_expressions</tt></i>
     and the remainder of the command are the same as in regular SQL.
    </p>
<p>     Note that this is quite different from
     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s normal interpretation of
     <tt class="command">SELECT INTO</tt>, where the <tt class="literal">INTO</tt> target
     is a newly created table.  If you want to create a table from a
     <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> result inside a
     <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span> function, use the syntax
     <tt class="command">CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT</tt>.
    </p>
<p>     If a row or a variable list is used as target, the selected values
     must exactly match the structure of the target, or a run-time error
     occurs.  When a record variable is the target, it automatically
     configures itself to the row type of the query result columns.
    </p>
<p>     Except for the <tt class="literal">INTO</tt> clause, the <tt class="command">SELECT</tt>
     statement is the same as a normal SQL <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> command
     and can use its full power.
    </p>
<p>     The <tt class="literal">INTO</tt> clause can appear almost anywhere in the
     <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> statement.  Customarily it is written
     either just after <tt class="literal">SELECT</tt> as shown above, or
     just before <tt class="literal">FROM</tt> [mdash ] that is, either just before
     or just after the list of <i class="replaceable"><tt>select_expressions</tt></i>.
    </p>
<p>     If the query returns zero rows, null values are assigned to the
     target(s).  If the query returns multiple rows, the first
     row is assigned to the target(s) and the rest are discarded.
     (Note that &#8220;<span class="quote">the first row</span>&#8221; is not well-defined unless you've
     used <tt class="literal">ORDER BY</tt>.)
    </p>
<p>     You can check the special <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> variable (see
     <a href="plpgsql-statements.html#plpgsql-statements-diagnostics" title="35.6.6. Obtaining the Result Status">Section 35.6.6, &#8220;Obtaining the Result Status&#8221;</a>) after a
     <tt class="command">SELECT INTO</tt> statement to determine whether the
     assignment was successful, that is, at least one row was was returned by
     the query. For example:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT INTO myrec * FROM emp WHERE empname = myname;
IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'employee % not found', myname;
END IF;</pre>
<p>
    </p>
<p>     To test for whether a record/row result is null, you can use the
     <tt class="literal">IS NULL</tt> conditional.  There is, however, no
     way to tell whether any additional rows might have been
     discarded.  Here is an example that handles the case where no
     rows have been returned:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">DECLARE
    users_rec RECORD;
BEGIN
    SELECT INTO users_rec * FROM users WHERE user_id=3;

    IF users_rec.homepage IS NULL THEN
        -- user entered no homepage, return "http://"
        RETURN 'http://';
    END IF;
END;</pre>

<a name="plpgsql-statements-perform"></a>35.6.3. Executing an Expression or Query With No Result</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>     Sometimes one wishes to evaluate an expression or query but
     discard the result (typically because one is calling a function
     that has useful side-effects but no useful result value).  To do
     this in <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>, use the
     <tt class="command">PERFORM</tt> statement:

</p>
<pre class="synopsis">PERFORM <i class="replaceable"><tt>query</tt></i>;</pre>
<p>

     This executes <i class="replaceable"><tt>query</tt></i> and discards the
     result.  Write the <i class="replaceable"><tt>query</tt></i> the same
     way as you would in an SQL <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> command, but replace the
     initial keyword <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> with <tt class="command">PERFORM</tt>.
     <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span> variables will be
     substituted into the query as usual.  Also, the special variable
     <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> is set to true if the query produced at
     least one row or false if it produced no rows.
    </p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>      One might expect that <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> with no
      <tt class="literal">INTO</tt> clause would accomplish this result, but at
      present the only accepted way to do it is
      <tt class="command">PERFORM</tt>.
     </p>

<a name="plpgsql-statements-null"></a>35.6.4. Doing Nothing At All</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>     Sometimes a placeholder statement that does nothing is useful.
     For example, it can indicate that one arm of an if/then/else
     chain is deliberately empty.  For this purpose, use the
     <tt class="command">NULL</tt> statement:

</p>
<pre class="synopsis">NULL;</pre>
<p>
    </p>
<p>     For example, the following two fragments of code are equivalent:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">    BEGIN
        y := x / 0;
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN division_by_zero THEN
            NULL;  -- ignore the error
    END;</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">    BEGIN
        y := x / 0;
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN division_by_zero THEN  -- ignore the error
    END;</pre>
<p>
     Which is preferable is a matter of taste.

<a name="plpgsql-statements-executing-dyn"></a>35.6.5. Executing Dynamic Commands</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>     Oftentimes you will want to generate dynamic commands inside your
     <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span> functions, that is, commands
     that will involve different tables or different data types each
     time they are executed.  <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>'s
     normal attempts to cache plans for commands will not work in such
     scenarios.  To handle this sort of problem, the
     <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt> statement is provided:

</p>
<pre class="synopsis">EXECUTE <i class="replaceable"><tt>command-string</tt></i>;</pre>
<p>

     where <i class="replaceable"><tt>command-string</tt></i> is an expression
     yielding a string (of type
     <tt class="type">text</tt>) containing the command
     to be executed.  This string is fed literally to the SQL engine.
    </p>
<p>     Note in particular that no substitution of <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>
     variables is done on the command string.  The values of variables must
     be inserted in the command string as it is constructed.
    </p>
<p>     Unlike all other commands in <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>, a command
     run by an <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt> statement is not prepared
     and saved just once during the life of the session.  Instead, the
     command is prepared each time the statement is run. The command
     string can be dynamically created within the function to perform
     actions on different tables and columns.
    </p>
<p>     The results from <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> commands are discarded
     by <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt>, and <tt class="command">SELECT INTO</tt>
     is not currently supported within <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt>.
     So there is no way to extract a result from a dynamically-created
     <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> using the plain <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt>
     command.  There are two other ways to do it, however: one is to use the
     <tt class="command">FOR-IN-EXECUTE</tt>
     loop form described in <a href="plpgsql-control-structures.html#plpgsql-records-iterating" title="35.7.4. Looping Through Query Results">Section 35.7.4, &#8220;Looping Through Query Results&#8221;</a>,
     and the other is to use a cursor with <tt class="command">OPEN-FOR-EXECUTE</tt>, as
     described in <a href="plpgsql-cursors.html#plpgsql-cursor-opening" title="35.8.2. Opening Cursors">Section 35.8.2, &#8220;Opening Cursors&#8221;</a>.
    </p>
<p>     When working with dynamic commands you will often have to handle escaping
     of single quotes.  The recommended method for quoting fixed text in your
     function body is dollar quoting.  (If you have legacy code that does
     not use dollar quoting, please refer to the
     overview in <a href="plpgsql-development-tips.html#plpgsql-quote-tips" title="35.2.1. Handling of Quotation Marks">Section 35.2.1, &#8220;Handling of Quotation Marks&#8221;</a>, which can save you
     some effort when translating said code to a more reasonable scheme.)
    </p>
<p>     Dynamic values that are to be inserted into the constructed
     query require special handling since they might themselves contain
     quote characters.
     An example (this assumes that you are using dollar quoting for the
     function as a whole, so the quote marks need not be doubled):
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = '
        || quote_literal(newvalue)
        || ' WHERE key = '
        || quote_literal(keyvalue);</pre>
<p>
    </p>
<p>     This example shows use of the functions
     <tt class="function">quote_ident(<tt class="type">text</tt>)</tt> and
     <tt class="function">quote_literal(<tt class="type">text</tt>)</tt>.<a name="id2649425"></a><a name="id2649434"></a> For safety, variables containing column and
     table identifiers should be passed to function
     <tt class="function">quote_ident</tt>.  Variables containing values
     that should be literal strings in the constructed command should
     be passed to <tt class="function">quote_literal</tt>.  Both take the
     appropriate steps to return the input text enclosed in double or
     single quotes respectively, with any embedded special characters
     properly escaped.
    </p>
<p>     Note that dollar quoting is only useful for quoting fixed text.
     It would be a very bad idea to try to do the above example as
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = $$'
        || newvalue
        || '$$ WHERE key = '
        || quote_literal(keyvalue);</pre>
<p>
     because it would break if the contents of <tt class="literal">newvalue</tt>
     happened to contain <tt class="literal">$$</tt>.  The same objection would
     apply to any other dollar-quoting delimiter you might pick.
     So, to safely quote text that is not known in advance, you
     <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> use <tt class="function">quote_literal</tt>.
    </p>
<p>     A much larger example of a dynamic command and
     <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt> can be seen in <a href="plpgsql-porting.html#plpgsql-porting-ex2" title="Example 35.5. Porting a Function that Creates Another Function from PL/SQL to PL/pgSQL">Example 35.5, &#8220;Porting a Function that Creates Another Function from PL/SQL to PL/pgSQL&#8221;</a>, which builds and executes a
     <tt class="command">CREATE FUNCTION</tt> command to define a new function.

<a name="plpgsql-statements-diagnostics"></a>35.6.6. Obtaining the Result Status</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>     There are several ways to determine the effect of a command. The
     first method is to use the <tt class="command">GET DIAGNOSTICS</tt>
     command, which has the form:

</p>
<pre class="synopsis">GET DIAGNOSTICS <i class="replaceable"><tt>variable</tt></i> = <i class="replaceable"><tt>item</tt></i> [<span class="optional"> , ... </span>] ;</pre>
<p>

     This command allows retrieval of system status indicators.  Each
     <i class="replaceable"><tt>item</tt></i> is a key word identifying a state
     value to be assigned to the specified variable (which should be
     of the right data type to receive it).  The currently available
     status items are <tt class="varname">ROW_COUNT</tt>, the number of rows
     processed by the last <span class="acronym">SQL</span> command sent down to
     the <span class="acronym">SQL</span> engine, and <tt class="varname">RESULT_OID</tt>,
     the OID of the last row inserted by the most recent
     <span class="acronym">SQL</span> command.  Note that <tt class="varname">RESULT_OID</tt>
     is only useful after an <tt class="command">INSERT</tt> command.
    </p>
<p>     An example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">GET DIAGNOSTICS integer_var = ROW_COUNT;</pre>
<p>
    </p>
<p>     The second method to determine the effects of a command is to check the
     special variable named <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt>, which is of
     type <tt class="type">boolean</tt>.  <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> starts out
     false within each <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span> function call.
     It is set by each of the following types of statements:
         </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>                A <tt class="command">SELECT INTO</tt> statement sets
                <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> true if it returns a row, false if no
                row is returned.
           </p></li>
<li><p>                A <tt class="command">PERFORM</tt> statement sets <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt>
                true if it produces (and discards) a row, false if no row is
                produced.
           </p></li>
<li><p>                <tt class="command">UPDATE</tt>, <tt class="command">INSERT</tt>, and <tt class="command">DELETE</tt>
                statements set <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> true if at least one
                row is affected, false if no row is affected.
           </p></li>
<li><p>                A <tt class="command">FETCH</tt> statement sets <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt>
                true if it returns a row, false if no row is returned.
           </p></li>
<li><p>                A <tt class="command">FOR</tt> statement sets <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> true
                if it iterates one or more times, else false.  This applies to
                all three variants of the <tt class="command">FOR</tt> statement (integer
                <tt class="command">FOR</tt> loops, record-set <tt class="command">FOR</tt> loops, and
                dynamic record-set <tt class="command">FOR</tt>
                loops). <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> is set this way when the
                <tt class="command">FOR</tt> loop exits; inside the execution of the loop,
                <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> is not modified by the
                <tt class="command">FOR</tt> statement, although it may be changed by the
                execution of other statements within the loop body.
           </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>

     <tt class="literal">FOUND</tt> is a local variable within each
     <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span> function; so any changes
     to it affect only the current function.
