<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre class="synopsis">PREPARE <i class="replaceable"><tt>plan_name</tt></i> [ (<i class="replaceable"><tt>datatype</tt></i> [, ...] ) ] AS <i class="replaceable"><tt>statement</tt></i></pre>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2695161"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <tt class="command">PREPARE</tt> creates a prepared statement. A prepared
   statement is a server-side object that can be used to optimize
   performance. When the <tt class="command">PREPARE</tt> statement is
   executed, the specified statement is parsed, rewritten, and
   planned. When an <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt> command is subsequently
   issued, the prepared statement need only be executed. Thus, the
   parsing, rewriting, and planning stages are only performed once,
   instead of every time the statement is executed.
  </p>
<p>   Prepared statements can take parameters: values that are
   substituted into the statement when it is executed. To include
   parameters in a prepared statement, supply a list of data types in
   the <tt class="command">PREPARE</tt> statement, and, in the statement to
   be prepared itself, refer to the parameters by position using
   <tt class="literal">$1</tt>, <tt class="literal">$2</tt>, etc. When executing
   the statement, specify the actual values for these parameters in
   the <tt class="command">EXECUTE</tt> statement.  Refer to <a href="sql-execute.html">EXECUTE</a> for more
   information about that.
  </p>
<p>   Prepared statements only last for the duration of the current
   database session. When the session ends, the prepared statement is
   forgotten, so it must be recreated before being used again. This 
   also means that a single  prepared statement cannot be used by
   multiple simultaneous database clients; however, each client can create
   their own prepared statement to use.  The prepared statement can be
   manually cleaned up using the <tt class="command">DEALLOCATE</tt> command.
  </p>
<p>   Prepared statements have the largest performance advantage when a
   single session is being used to execute a large number of similar
   statements. The performance difference will be particularly
   significant if the statements are complex to plan or rewrite, for
   example, if the query involves a join of many tables or requires
   the application of several rules. If the statement is relatively simple
   to plan and rewrite but relatively expensive to execute, the
   performance advantage of prepared statements will be less noticeable.

<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><i class="replaceable"><tt>plan_name</tt></i></span></dt>
<dd><p>      An arbitrary name given to this particular prepared
      statement. It must be unique within a single session and is
      subsequently used to execute or deallocate a previously prepared
      statement.
     </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><i class="replaceable"><tt>datatype</tt></i></span></dt>
<dd><p>      The data type of a parameter to the prepared statement.  To
      refer to the parameters in the prepared statement itself, use
      <tt class="literal">$1</tt>, <tt class="literal">$2</tt>, etc.

<dd><p>      Any <tt class="command">SELECT</tt>, <tt class="command">INSERT</tt>, <tt class="command">UPDATE</tt>,

<a name="id2695337"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>   In some situations, the query plan produced for a prepared
   statement will be inferior to the query plan that would have been
   chosen if the statement had been submitted and executed
   normally. This is because when the statement is planned and the
   planner attempts to determine the optimal query plan, the actual
   values of any parameters specified in the statement are
   unavailable. <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> collects
   statistics on the distribution of data in the table, and can use
   constant values in a statement to make guesses about the likely
   result of executing the statement. Since this data is unavailable
   when planning prepared statements with parameters, the chosen plan
   may be suboptimal. To examine the query plan
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> has chosen for a prepared
   statement, use <a href="sql-explain.html">EXPLAIN</a>.
  </p>
<p>   For more information on query planning and the statistics collected
   by <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> for that purpose, see
   the <a href="sql-analyze.html">ANALYZE</a>
   documentation.

<a name="sql-prepare-examples"></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<p>   Create a prepared query for an <tt class="command">INSERT</tt> statement,
   and then execute it:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">PREPARE fooplan (int, text, bool, numeric) AS
    INSERT INTO foo VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
EXECUTE fooplan(1, 'Hunter Valley', 't', 200.00);</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Create a prepared query for a <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> statement,
   and then execute it:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">PREPARE usrrptplan (int, date) AS
    SELECT * FROM users u, logs l WHERE u.usrid=$1 AND u.usrid=l.usrid
    AND l.date = $2;
EXECUTE usrrptplan(1, current_date);</pre>
<p>
  </p>

<a name="id2695444"></a><h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>   The SQL standard includes a <tt class="command">PREPARE</tt> statement,
   but it is only for use in embedded SQL. This version of the
   <tt class="command">PREPARE</tt> statement also uses a somewhat different
   syntax.
