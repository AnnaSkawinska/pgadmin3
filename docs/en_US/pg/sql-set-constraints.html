<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre class="synopsis">SET CONSTRAINTS { ALL | <i class="replaceable"><tt>name</tt></i> [, ...] } { DEFERRED | IMMEDIATE }</pre>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2702450"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS</tt> sets the behavior of constraint
   checking within the current transaction. <tt class="literal">IMMEDIATE</tt>
   constraints are checked at the end of each
   statement. <tt class="literal">DEFERRED</tt> constraints are not checked until
   transaction commit.  Each constraint has its own
   <tt class="literal">IMMEDIATE</tt> or <tt class="literal">DEFERRED</tt> mode.
  </p>
<p>   Upon creation, a constraint is given one of three
   characteristics: <tt class="literal">DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED</tt>,
   <tt class="literal">DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE</tt>, or
   <tt class="literal">NOT DEFERRABLE</tt>. The third
   class is always <tt class="literal">IMMEDIATE</tt> and is not affected by the
   <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS</tt> command.  The first two classes start
   every transaction in the indicated mode, but their behavior can be changed
   within a transaction by <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS</tt>.
  </p>
<p>   <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS</tt> with a list of constraint names changes
   the mode of just those constraints (which must all be deferrable).  If
   there are multiple constraints matching any given name, all are affected.
   <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS ALL</tt> changes the mode of all deferrable
   constraints.
  </p>
<p>   When <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS</tt> changes the mode of a constraint
   from <tt class="literal">DEFERRED</tt>
   to <tt class="literal">IMMEDIATE</tt>, the new mode takes effect
   retroactively: any outstanding data modifications that would have
   been checked at the end of the transaction are instead checked during the
   execution of the <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS</tt> command.
   If any such constraint is violated, the <tt class="command">SET CONSTRAINTS</tt>
   fails (and does not change the constraint mode).  Thus, <tt class="command">SET
   CONSTRAINTS</tt> can be used to force checking of constraints to
   occur at a specific point in a transaction.
  </p>
<p>   Currently, only foreign key constraints are affected by this
   setting. Check and unique constraints are always effectively
   not deferrable.

<a name="id2702589"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>   This command only alters the behavior of constraints within the
   current transaction. Thus, if you execute this command outside of a
   transaction block
   (<tt class="command">BEGIN</tt>/<tt class="command">COMMIT</tt> pair), it will
   not appear to have any effect.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2702608"></a><h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>   This command complies with the behavior defined in the SQL
   standard, except for the limitation that, in
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, it only applies to
   foreign-key constraints.
  </p>
<p>   The SQL standard says that constraint names appearing in <tt class="command">SET
   CONSTRAINTS</tt> can be schema-qualified.  This is not yet
   supported by <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>: the names must
   be unqualified, and all constraints matching the command will be
   affected no matter which schema they are in.
