<li>
<a name="configure"></a><p class="title"><b>Configuration</b></p>
<a name="id2575306"></a><p>    The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
    source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
    This is done by running the <tt class="filename">configure</tt> script. For a
    default installation simply enter
</p>
<pre class="screen"><b class="userinput"><tt>./configure</tt></b></pre>
<p>
    This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
    system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.  (You can also run
    <tt class="filename">configure</tt> in a directory outside the source
    tree if you want to keep the build directory separate.)
   </p>
<p>    The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
    well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
    C compiler. All files will be installed under
    <tt class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql</tt> by default.
   </p>
<p>    You can customize the build and installation process by supplying one
    or more of the following command line options to
    <tt class="filename">configure</tt>:

     </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="option">--prefix=<i class="replaceable"><tt>PREFIX</tt></i></tt></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>         Install all files under the directory <i class="replaceable"><tt>PREFIX</tt></i>
         instead of <tt class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql</tt>. The actual
         files will be installed into various subdirectories; no files
         will ever be installed directly into the
         <i class="replaceable"><tt>PREFIX</tt></i> directory.
        </p>
<p>         If you have special needs, you can also customize the
         individual subdirectories with the following options. However,
         if you leave these with their defaults, the installation will be
         relocatable, meaning you can move the directory after
         installation. (The <tt class="literal">man</tt> and <tt class="literal">doc</tt>
         locations are not affected by this.)
        </p>
<p>         For relocatable installs, you might want to use 
         <tt class="filename">configure</tt>'s <tt class="literal">--disable-rpath</tt>
         option.  Also, you will need to tell the operating system how
         to find the shared libraries.
        </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="option">--exec-prefix=<i class="replaceable"><tt>EXEC-PREFIX</tt></i></tt></span></dt>
<dd><p>         You can install architecture-dependent files under a
         different prefix, <i class="replaceable"><tt>EXEC-PREFIX</tt></i>, than what
         <i class="replaceable"><tt>PREFIX</tt></i> was set to. This can be useful to
         share architecture-independent files between hosts. If you
         omit this, then <i class="replaceable"><tt>EXEC-PREFIX</tt></i> is set equal to
         <i class="replaceable"><tt>PREFIX</tt></i> and both architecture-dependent and
         independent files will be installed under the same tree,
         which is probably what you want.

         nothing to do with where your database files will be placed.

<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>       Care has been taken to make it possible to install
       <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> into shared installation locations
       (such as <tt class="filename">/usr/local/include</tt>) without
       interfering with the namespace of the rest of the system. First,
       the string &#8220;<span class="quote"><tt class="literal">/postgresql</tt></span>&#8221; is
       automatically appended to <tt class="varname">datadir</tt>,
       <tt class="varname">sysconfdir</tt>, and <tt class="varname">docdir</tt>,
       unless the fully expanded directory name already contains the
       string &#8220;<span class="quote"><tt class="literal">postgres</tt></span>&#8221; or
       &#8220;<span class="quote"><tt class="literal">pgsql</tt></span>&#8221;. For example, if you choose
       <tt class="filename">/usr/local</tt> as prefix, the documentation will
       be installed in <tt class="filename">/usr/local/doc/postgresql</tt>,
       but if the prefix is <tt class="filename">/opt/postgres</tt>, then it
       will be in <tt class="filename">/opt/postgres/doc</tt>. The public C
       header files of the client interfaces are installed into
       <tt class="varname">includedir</tt> and are namespace-clean. The
       internal header files and the server header files are installed
       into private directories under <tt class="varname">includedir</tt>. See
       the documentation of each interface for information about how to
       get at the its header files. Finally, a private subdirectory will
       also be created, if appropriate, under <tt class="varname">libdir</tt>
       for dynamically loadable modules.

         <i class="replaceable"><tt>LANGUAGES</tt></i> is a space-separated
         list of codes of the languages that you want supported, for

         server and clients will have the same default compiled in,
         which can be very convenient.  Usually the only good reason

         spinlock support will result in poor performance; therefore,
         this option should only be used if the build aborts and
         informs you that the platform lacks spinlock support. If this

<dd><p>         Compiles all programs and libraries with debugging symbols.
         This means that you can run the programs through a debugger
         to analyze problems. This enlarges the size of the installed
         executables considerably, and on non-GCC compilers it usually
         also disables compiler optimization, causing slowdowns. However,
         having the symbols available is extremely helpful for dealing
         with any problems that may arise.  Currently, this option is
         recommended for production installations only if you use GCC.
         But you should always have it on if you are doing development work

         code development purposes, but the tests slow things down a little.
         Also, having the tests turned on won't necessarily enhance the
         stability of your server!  The assertion checks are not categorized
         for severity, and so what might be a relatively harmless bug will
         still lead to server restarts if it triggers an assertion
         failure.  Currently, this option is not recommended for
         production use, but you should have it on for development work

<dd><p>         Enables automatic dependency tracking.  With this option, the
         makefiles are set up so that all affected object files will
         be rebuilt when any header file is changed.  This is useful
         if you are doing development work, but is just wasted overhead
         if you intend only to compile once and install.  At present,

<p>    You can use <tt class="literal">gmake install-strip</tt> instead of
    <tt class="literal">gmake install</tt> to strip the executable files and
    libraries as they are installed.  This will save some space.  If
    you built with debugging support, stripping will effectively
    remove the debugging support, so it should only be done if
    debugging is no longer needed.  <tt class="literal">install-strip</tt>
    tries to do a reasonable job saving space, but it does not have
    perfect knowledge of how to strip every unneeded byte from an
    executable file, so if you want to save all the disk space you
    possibly can, you will have to do manual work.

<p>    The standard installation provides all the header files needed for client
    application development as well as for server-side program
    development, such as custom functions or data types written in C.
    (Prior to <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.0, a separate <tt class="literal">gmake
    install-all-headers</tt> command was needed for the latter, but this
    step has been folded into the standard install.)
   </p>
<p><b>Client-only installation: </b>     If you want to install only the client applications and
     interface libraries, then you can use these commands:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><b class="userinput"><tt>gmake -C src/bin install</tt></b>
<b class="userinput"><tt>gmake -C src/include install</tt></b>
<b class="userinput"><tt>gmake -C src/interfaces install</tt></b>
<b class="userinput"><tt>gmake -C doc install</tt></b></pre>
<p>
    </p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p><b>Registering <span class="application">eventlog</span> on <span class="systemitem">Windows</span>: </b>    To register a <span class="systemitem">Windows</span> <span class="application">eventlog</span>
    library with the operating system, issue this command after installation:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><b class="userinput"><tt>regsvr32 <i class="replaceable"><tt>pgsql_library_directory</tt></i>/pgevent.dll</tt></b></pre>
<p>
    This creates registry entries used by the event viewer.
   </p>
<p><b>Uninstallation: </b>    To undo the installation use the command <tt class="command">gmake
    uninstall</tt>. However, this will not remove any created directories.
   </p>
<p><b>Cleaning: </b>    After the installation you can make room by removing the built
    files from the source tree with the command <tt class="command">gmake
    clean</tt>. This will preserve the files made by the <tt class="command">configure</tt>
    program, so that you can rebuild everything with <tt class="command">gmake</tt>
    later on. To reset the source tree to the state in which it was
    distributed, use <tt class="command">gmake distclean</tt>. If you are going to
    build for several platforms within the same source tree you must do
    this and re-configure for each build.  (Alternatively, use
    a separate build tree for each platform, so that the source tree
    remains unmodified.)
   </p>
<p>   If you perform a build and then discover that your <tt class="command">configure</tt>
   options were wrong, or if you change anything that <tt class="command">configure</tt>
   investigates (for example, software upgrades), then it's a good
   idea to do <tt class="command">gmake distclean</tt> before reconfiguring and
   rebuilding.  Without this, your changes in configuration choices
   may not propagate everywhere they need to.
