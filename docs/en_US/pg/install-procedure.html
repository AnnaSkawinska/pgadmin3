    default installation simply enter
</P><PRE

    This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
    system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.  (You can also run
    <TT

    tree if you want to keep the build directory separate.)

	 also disables compiler optimization, causing slowdowns. However,

>    The standard installation provides only the header files needed for client

    This adds a megabyte or two to the installation footprint, and is only
    useful if you don't plan to keep the whole source tree around for
    reference.  (If you do, you can just use the source's include
    directory when building server-side software.)

    this and re-configure for each build.
