<p>   Data partitioning splits tables into data sets.  Each set can only be
   modified by one server.  For example, data can be partitioned by
   offices, e.g. London and Paris.  While London and Paris servers have all
   data records, only London can modify London records, and Paris can only
   modify Paris records.
  </p>
<p>   Such partitioning implements both failover and load balancing.  Failover
   is achieved because the data resides on both servers, and this is an
   ideal way to enable failover if the servers share a slow communication
   channel. Load balancing is possible because read requests can go to any
   of the servers, and write requests are split among the servers.  Of
   course, the communication to keep all the servers up-to-date adds
   overhead, so ideally the write load should be low, or localized as in
   the London/Paris example above.
  </p>
<p>   Data partitioning is usually handled by application code, though rules
   and triggers can be used to keep the read-only data sets current.  Slony
   can also be used in such a setup.  While Slony replicates only entire
   tables, London and Paris can be placed in separate tables, and
   inheritance can be used to access both tables using a single table name.
