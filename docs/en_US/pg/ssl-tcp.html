<a name="id2591796"></a><p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> has native support for using
   <span class="acronym">SSL</span> connections to encrypt client/server communications
   for increased security. This requires that
   <span class="productname">OpenSSL</span> is installed on both client and
   server systems and that support in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> is
   enabled at build time (see <a href="installation.html" title="Chapter 14.   Installation Instructions">Chapter 14, <i>  Installation Instructions</i></a>).
  </p>
<p>   With <span class="acronym">SSL</span> support compiled in, the
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server can be started with
   <span class="acronym">SSL</span> enabled by setting the parameter
   <a href="runtime-config.html#guc-ssl">ssl</a> to <tt class="literal">on</tt> in
   <tt class="filename">postgresql.conf</tt>. When
   starting in <span class="acronym">SSL</span> mode, the server will look for the
   files <tt class="filename">server.key</tt> and <tt class="filename">server.crt</tt> in the
   data directory, which must contain the server private key
   and certificate, respectively. These files must be set up correctly
   before an <span class="acronym">SSL</span>-enabled server can start. If the private key is
   protected with a passphrase, the server will prompt for the
   passphrase and will not start until it has been entered.
  </p>
<p>   The server will listen for both standard and <span class="acronym">SSL</span>
   connections on the same TCP port, and will negotiate with any
   connecting client on whether to use <span class="acronym">SSL</span>.  By default,
   this is at the client's option; see <a href="client-authentication.html#auth-pg-hba-conf" title="19.1. The pg_hba.conf file">Section 19.1, &#8220;The pg_hba.conf file&#8221;</a> about how to set up the server to
   require use of <span class="acronym">SSL</span> for some or all connections.
  </p>
<p>   For details on how to create your server private key and certificate,
   refer to the <span class="productname">OpenSSL</span> documentation. A
   self-signed certificate can be used for testing, but a
   certificate signed by a certificate authority (<span class="acronym">CA</span>)
   (either one of the global
   <span class="acronym">CAs</span> or a local one) should be used in production so the
   client can verify the server's identity. To create a quick
   self-signed certificate, use the following
   <span class="productname">OpenSSL</span> command:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">openssl req -new -text -out server.req</pre>
<p>
   Fill out the information that <tt class="command">openssl</tt> asks for. Make sure
   that you enter the local host name as &#8220;<span class="quote">Common Name</span>&#8221;; the challenge
   password can be left blank. The program will generate a key that is
   passphrase protected; it will not accept a passphrase that is less
   than four characters long. To remove the passphrase (as you must if
   you want automatic start-up of the server), run the commands
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out server.key
rm privkey.pem</pre>
<p>
   Enter the old passphrase to unlock the existing key. Now do
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">openssl req -x509 -in server.req -text -key server.key -out server.crt
chmod og-rwx server.key</pre>
<p>
   to turn the certificate into a self-signed certificate and to copy the
   key and certificate to where the server will look for them.
  </p>
<p>   If verification of client certificates is required, place the
   certificates of the <span class="acronym">CA</span>(s) you wish to check for in
   the file <tt class="filename">root.crt</tt> in the data directory.  When
   present, a client certificate will be requested from the client
   during SSL connection startup, and it must have been signed by one of the
   certificates present in <tt class="filename">root.crt</tt>.
  </p>
<p>   When the <tt class="filename">root.crt</tt> file is not present, client
   certificates will not be requested or checked.  In this mode, SSL
   provides communication security but not authentication.
  </p>
<p>   The files <tt class="filename">server.key</tt>, <tt class="filename">server.crt</tt>,
   and <tt class="filename">root.crt</tt> are only examined during server
   start; so you must restart the server to make changes in them take
   effect.
