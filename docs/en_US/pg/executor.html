<p>    The <i class="firstterm">executor</i> takes the plan handed back by the
    planner/optimizer and recursively processes it to extract the required set
    of rows.  This is essentially a demand-pull pipeline mechanism.
    Each time a plan node is called, it must deliver one more row, or
    report that it is done delivering rows.
   </p>
<p>    To provide a concrete example, assume that the top
    node is a <tt class="literal">MergeJoin</tt> node. 
    Before any merge can be done two rows have to be fetched (one from
    each subplan). So the executor recursively calls itself to
    process the subplans (it starts with the subplan attached to
    <tt class="literal">lefttree</tt>). The new top node (the top node of the left
    subplan) is, let's say, a
    <tt class="literal">Sort</tt> node and again recursion is needed to obtain
    an input row.  The child node of the <tt class="literal">Sort</tt> might
    be a <tt class="literal">SeqScan</tt> node, representing actual reading of a table.
    Execution of this node causes the executor to fetch a row from the
    table and return it up to the calling node.  The <tt class="literal">Sort</tt>
    node will repeatedly call its child to obtain all the rows to be sorted.
    When the input is exhausted (as indicated by the child node returning
    a NULL instead of a row), the <tt class="literal">Sort</tt> code performs
    the sort, and finally is able to return its first output row, namely
    the first one in sorted order.  It keeps the remaining rows stored so
    that it can deliver them in sorted order in response to later demands.
   </p>
<p>    The <tt class="literal">MergeJoin</tt> node similarly demands the first row
    from its right subplan.  Then it compares the two rows to see if they
    can be joined; if so, it returns a join row to its caller.  On the next
    call, or immediately if it cannot join the current pair of inputs,
    it advances to the next row of one table
    or the other (depending on how the comparison came out), and again
    checks for a match.  Eventually, one subplan or the other is exhausted,
    and the <tt class="literal">MergeJoin</tt> node returns NULL to indicate that
    no more join rows can be formed.
   </p>
<p>    Complex queries may involve many levels of plan nodes, but the general
    approach is the same: each node computes and returns its next output
    row each time it is called.  Each node is also responsible for applying
    any selection or projection expressions that were assigned to it by
    the planner.
   </p>
<p>    The executor mechanism is used to evaluate all four basic SQL query types:
    <tt class="command">SELECT</tt>, <tt class="command">INSERT</tt>, <tt class="command">UPDATE</tt>, and
    <tt class="command">DELETE</tt>.  For <tt class="command">SELECT</tt>, the top-level executor
    code only needs to send each row returned by the query plan tree off
    to the client.  For <tt class="command">INSERT</tt>, each returned row is inserted
    into the target table specified for the <tt class="command">INSERT</tt>.  (A simple
    <tt class="command">INSERT ... VALUES</tt> command creates a trivial plan tree
    consisting of a single <tt class="literal">Result</tt> node, which computes just one
    result row.  But <tt class="command">INSERT ... SELECT</tt> may demand the full power
    of the executor mechanism.)  For <tt class="command">UPDATE</tt>, the planner arranges
    that each computed row includes all the updated column values, plus
    the <i class="firstterm">TID</i> (tuple ID, or row ID) of the original target row;
    the executor top level uses this information to create a new updated row
    and mark the old row deleted.  For <tt class="command">DELETE</tt>, the only column
    that is actually returned by the plan is the TID, and the executor top
    level simply uses the TID to visit each target row and mark it deleted.
