<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre class="synopsis">LOCK [ TABLE ] <i class="replaceable"><tt>name</tt></i> [, ...] [ IN <i class="replaceable"><tt>lockmode</tt></i> MODE ] [ NOWAIT ]

where <i class="replaceable"><tt>lockmode</tt></i> is one of:

<a name="id2694033"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> obtains a table-level lock, waiting
   if necessary for any conflicting locks to be released.  If
   <tt class="literal">NOWAIT</tt> is specified, <tt class="command">LOCK
   TABLE</tt> does not wait to acquire the desired lock: if it
   cannot be acquired immediately, the command is aborted and an
   error is emitted.  Once obtained, the lock is held for the
   remainder of the current transaction.  (There is no <tt class="command">UNLOCK
   TABLE</tt> command; locks are always released at transaction
   end.)
  </p>
<p>   When acquiring locks automatically for commands that reference
   tables, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> always uses the least
   restrictive lock mode possible. <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt>
   provides for cases when you might need more restrictive locking.
   For example, suppose an application runs a transaction at the
   Read Committed isolation level and needs to ensure that data in a
   table remains stable for the duration of the transaction. To
   achieve this you could obtain <tt class="literal">SHARE</tt> lock mode over the
   table before querying. This will prevent concurrent data changes
   and ensure subsequent reads of the table see a stable view of
   committed data, because <tt class="literal">SHARE</tt> lock mode conflicts with
   the <tt class="literal">ROW EXCLUSIVE</tt> lock acquired by writers, and your
   <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE <i class="replaceable"><tt>name</tt></i> IN SHARE MODE</tt>
   statement will wait until any concurrent holders of <tt class="literal">ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</tt> mode locks commit or roll back. Thus, once you
   obtain the lock, there are no uncommitted writes outstanding;
   furthermore none can begin until you release the lock.
  </p>
<p>   To achieve a similar effect when running a transaction at the Serializable
   isolation level, you have to execute the <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> statement
   before executing any <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> or data modification statement.
   A serializable transaction's view of data will be frozen when its first
   <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> or data modification statement begins.  A <tt class="command">LOCK
   TABLE</tt> later in the transaction will still prevent concurrent writes
   [mdash ] but it won't ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds to
   the latest committed values.
  </p>
<p>   If a transaction of this sort is going to change the data in the
   table, then it should use <tt class="literal">SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</tt> lock mode
   instead of <tt class="literal">SHARE</tt> mode.  This ensures that only one
   transaction of this type runs at a time.  Without this, a deadlock
   is possible: two transactions might both acquire <tt class="literal">SHARE</tt>
   mode, and then be unable to also acquire <tt class="literal">ROW EXCLUSIVE</tt>
   mode to actually perform their updates.  (Note that a transaction's
   own locks never conflict, so a transaction can acquire <tt class="literal">ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</tt> mode when it holds <tt class="literal">SHARE</tt> mode [mdash ] but not
   if anyone else holds <tt class="literal">SHARE</tt> mode.)  To avoid deadlocks,
   make sure all transactions acquire locks on the same objects in the
   same order, and if multiple lock modes are involved for a single
   object, then transactions should always acquire the most
   restrictive mode first.
  </p>
<p>   More information about the lock modes and locking strategies can be
   found in <a href="explicit-locking.html" title="12.3. Explicit Locking">Section 12.3, &#8220;Explicit Locking&#8221;</a>.

<a name="id2694236"></a><h2>Parameters</h2>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><i class="replaceable"><tt>name</tt></i></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>      The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table to
      lock.
     </p>
<p>      The command <tt class="literal">LOCK TABLE a, b;</tt> is equivalent to
      <tt class="literal">LOCK TABLE a; LOCK TABLE b;</tt>. The tables are locked
      one-by-one in the order specified in the <tt class="command">LOCK
      TABLE</tt> command.
     </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><i class="replaceable"><tt>lockmode</tt></i></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>      The lock mode specifies which locks this lock conflicts with.
      Lock modes are described in <a href="explicit-locking.html" title="12.3. Explicit Locking">Section 12.3, &#8220;Explicit Locking&#8221;</a>.
     </p>
<p>      If no lock mode is specified, then <tt class="literal">ACCESS
      EXCLUSIVE</tt>, the most restrictive mode, is used.
     </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="literal">NOWAIT</tt></span></dt>
<dd><p>      Specifies that <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> should not wait for
      any conflicting locks to be released: if the specified lock(s)
      cannot be acquired immediately without waiting, the transaction
      is aborted.

<a name="id2694322"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>    <tt class="literal">LOCK TABLE ... IN ACCESS SHARE MODE</tt> requires <tt class="literal">SELECT</tt>
    privileges on the target table.  All other forms of <tt class="command">LOCK</tt>
    require <tt class="literal">UPDATE</tt> and/or <tt class="literal">DELETE</tt> privileges.
   </p>
<p>    <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> is useful only inside a transaction
    block (<tt class="command">BEGIN</tt>/<tt class="command">COMMIT</tt> pair), since the lock
    is dropped as soon as the transaction ends.  A <tt class="command">LOCK
    TABLE</tt> command appearing outside any transaction block forms a
    self-contained transaction, so the lock will be dropped as soon as
    it is obtained.
   </p>
<p>   <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> only deals with table-level locks, and so
   the mode names involving <tt class="literal">ROW</tt> are all misnomers.  These
   mode names should generally be read as indicating the intention of
   the user to acquire row-level locks within the locked table.  Also,
   <tt class="literal">ROW EXCLUSIVE</tt> mode is a sharable table lock.  Keep in
   mind that all the lock modes have identical semantics so far as
   <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> is concerned, differing only in the rules
   about which modes conflict with which. For information on how to
   acquire an actual row-level lock, see <a href="explicit-locking.html#locking-rows" title="12.3.2. Row-Level Locks">Section 12.3.2, &#8220;Row-Level Locks&#8221;</a>
   and the <a href="sql-select.html#sql-for-update"><tt class="literal">FOR UPDATE</tt> Clause</a> in the <tt class="command">SELECT</tt>
   reference documentation.

<a name="id2694449"></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<p>   Obtain a <tt class="literal">SHARE</tt> lock on a primary key table when going to perform
   inserts into a foreign key table:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">BEGIN WORK;
LOCK TABLE films IN SHARE MODE;
SELECT id FROM films 
    WHERE name = 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace';
-- Do ROLLBACK if record was not returned
INSERT INTO films_user_comments VALUES 
    (_id_, 'GREAT! I was waiting for it for so long!');
COMMIT WORK;</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Take a <tt class="literal">SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</tt> lock on a primary key table when going to perform
   a delete operation:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">BEGIN WORK;
LOCK TABLE films IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE;
DELETE FROM films_user_comments WHERE id IN
    (SELECT id FROM films WHERE rating &lt; 5);
DELETE FROM films WHERE rating &lt; 5;
COMMIT WORK;</pre>

<a name="id2694493"></a><h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>   There is no <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> in the SQL standard,
   which instead uses <tt class="command">SET TRANSACTION</tt> to specify
   concurrency levels on transactions.  <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports that too;
   see <a href="sql-set-transaction.html">SET TRANSACTION</a> for details.
  </p>
<p>   Except for <tt class="literal">ACCESS SHARE</tt>, <tt class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</tt>,
   and <tt class="literal">SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE</tt> lock modes, the
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> lock modes and the
   <tt class="command">LOCK TABLE</tt> syntax are compatible with those
   present in <span class="productname">Oracle</span>.
