><P
>   Another useful tool for monitoring database activity is the
   <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_locks</VAR
> system table.  It allows the
   database administrator to view information about the outstanding
   locks in the lock manager. For example, this capability can be used
   to:
	
   <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>      View all the locks currently outstanding, all the locks on
      relations in a particular database, all the locks on a
      particular relation, or all the locks held by a particular
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> session.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Determine the relation in the current database with the most
      ungranted locks (which might be a source of contention among
      database clients).
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Determine the effect of lock contention on overall database
      performance, as well as the extent to which contention varies
      with overall database traffic.
     </P
></LI
></UL
><P>

CLASS="NOTE"

>Note: </B
>    When the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_locks</VAR
> view is accessed, the
    internal lock manager data structures are momentarily locked, and
    a copy is made for the view to display.  This ensures that the
    view produces a consistent set of results, while not blocking
    normal lock manager operations longer than necessary.  Nonetheless
    there could be some impact on database performance if this view is
    read often.

HREF="monitoring-locks.html#MONITORING-LOCKS-TABLE"
>Table 23-3</A

   <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_locks</VAR
> columns.  The
   <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_locks</VAR
> view contains one row per lockable
   object and requested lock mode.  Thus, the same lockable object may
   appear many times, if multiple transactions are holding or waiting
   for locks on it.  A lockable object is either a relation (e.g., a table) or a
   transaction ID.  (Note that this view includes only table-level
   locks, not row-level ones.  If a transaction is waiting for a
   row-level lock, it will appear in the view as waiting for the
   transaction ID of the current holder of that row lock.)

       False indicates that this session is currently waiting to
       acquire this lock, which implies that some other session is
       holding a conflicting lock mode on the same lockable object.
       The waiting session will sleep until the other lock is released (or a
       deadlock situation is detected). A single session can be
       waiting to acquire at most one lock at a time.
