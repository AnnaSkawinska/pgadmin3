<a name="id2713015"></a><p>   Normally, PL/Perl is installed as a &#8220;<span class="quote">trusted</span>&#8221; programming
   language named <code class="literal">plperl</code>.  In this setup, certain Perl
   operations are disabled to preserve security.  In general, the
   operations that are restricted are those that interact with the
   environment. This includes file handle operations,
   <code class="literal">require</code>, and <code class="literal">use</code> (for
   external modules).  There is no way to access internals of the
   database server process or to gain OS-level access with the
   permissions of the server process,
   as a C function can do.  Thus, any unprivileged database user may
   be permitted to use this language.
  </p>
<p>   Here is an example of a function that will not work because file
   system operations are not allowed for security reasons:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE FUNCTION badfunc() RETURNS integer AS $$
    my $tmpfile = "/tmp/badfile";
    open my $fh, '&gt;', $tmpfile
        or elog(ERROR, qq{Could not open the file "$tmpfile": $!});
    print $fh "Testing writing to a file\n";
    close $fh or elog(ERROR, qq{Could not close the file "$tmpfile": $!});
    return 1;
$$ LANGUAGE plperl;</pre>
<p>
	The creation of this function will fail as its use of a forbidden
	operation will be be caught by the validator.
  </p>
<p>   Sometimes it is desirable to write Perl functions that are not
   restricted.  For example, one might want a Perl function that sends
   mail.  To handle these cases, PL/Perl can also be installed as an
   &#8220;<span class="quote">untrusted</span>&#8221; language (usually called
   <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span><a name="id2713102"></a>).
   In this case the full Perl language is available.  If the
   <code class="command">createlang</code> program is used to install the
   language, the language name <code class="literal">plperlu</code> will select
   the untrusted PL/Perl variant.
  </p>
<p>   The writer of a <span class="application">PL/PerlU</span> function must take care that the function
   cannot be used to do anything unwanted, since it will be able to do
   anything that could be done by a user logged in as the database
   administrator.  Note that the database system allows only database
   superusers to create functions in untrusted languages.
  </p>
<p>   If the above function was created by a superuser using the language
   <code class="literal">plperlu</code>, execution would succeed.
  </p>
