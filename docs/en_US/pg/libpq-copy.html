<a name="libpq-copy"></a>27.8. Functions Associated with the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> Command</h2></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<a name="id2613959"></a><p> The <tt class="command">COPY</tt> command in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
 has options to read from or write to the network connection used by
 <span class="application">libpq</span>.  The functions described in this section
 allow applications to take advantage of this capability by supplying or
 consuming copied data.</p>
<p> The overall process is that the application first issues the SQL
 <tt class="command">COPY</tt> command via <tt class="function">PQexec</tt> or one
 of the equivalent functions.  The response to this (if there is no error
 in the command) will be a <tt class="structname">PGresult</tt> object bearing a status
 code of <tt class="literal">PGRES_COPY_OUT</tt> or <tt class="literal">PGRES_COPY_IN</tt>
 (depending on the specified copy direction).  The application should then
 use the functions of this section to receive or transmit data rows.
 When the data transfer is complete, another <tt class="structname">PGresult</tt> object
 is returned to indicate success or failure of the transfer.  Its status
 will be <tt class="literal">PGRES_COMMAND_OK</tt> for success or
 <tt class="literal">PGRES_FATAL_ERROR</tt> if some problem was encountered.
 At this point further SQL commands may be issued via
 <tt class="function">PQexec</tt>.  (It is not possible to execute other SQL
 commands using the same connection while the <tt class="command">COPY</tt>
 operation is in progress.)</p>
<p> If a <tt class="command">COPY</tt> command is issued via
 <tt class="function">PQexec</tt> in a string that could contain additional
 commands, the application must continue fetching results via
 <tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt> after completing the <tt class="command">COPY</tt>
 sequence.  Only when <tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt> returns <tt class="symbol">NULL</tt> is it certain
 that the <tt class="function">PQexec</tt> command string is done and it is
 safe to issue more commands.</p>
<p> The functions of this section should be executed only after obtaining a
 result status of <tt class="literal">PGRES_COPY_OUT</tt> or
 <tt class="literal">PGRES_COPY_IN</tt> from <tt class="function">PQexec</tt> or
 <tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt>.</p>
<p> A <tt class="structname">PGresult</tt> object bearing one of these status values
 carries some additional data about the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> operation that
 is starting.  This additional data is available using functions that are
 also used in connection with query results:

</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQnfields</tt><a name="id2614161"></a></span></dt>
<dd><p>          Returns the number of columns (fields) to be copied.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQbinaryTuples</tt><a name="id2614180"></a></span></dt>
<dd><p>                0 indicates the overall copy format is textual (rows
                separated by newlines, columns separated by separator
                characters, etc).
                1 indicates the overall copy format is binary.
                See <a href="sql-copy.html">COPY</a>
                for more information.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQfformat</tt><a name="id2614212"></a></span></dt>
<dd><p>          Returns the format code (0 for text, 1 for binary) associated
          with each column of the copy operation.  The per-column format
          codes will always be zero when the overall copy format is textual,
          but the binary format can support both text and binary columns.
          (However, as of the current implementation of <tt class="command">COPY</tt>,
          only binary columns appear in a binary copy; so the per-column
          formats always match the overall format at present.)</p></dd>

<p> Sends data to the server during <tt class="literal">COPY_IN</tt> state.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQputCopyData(PGconn *conn,
                  const char *buffer,
                  int nbytes);</pre>
<p>Transmits the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> data in the specified <i class="parameter"><tt>buffer</tt></i>, of length
<i class="parameter"><tt>nbytes</tt></i>, to the server.  The result is 1 if the data was sent,
zero if it was not sent because the attempt would block (this case is only
possible if the connection is in nonblocking mode), or -1 if an error occurred.
(Use <tt class="function">PQerrorMessage</tt> to retrieve details if the return
value is -1.  If the value is zero, wait for write-ready and try again.)</p>
<p>The application may divide the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> data stream into buffer loads of any
convenient size.  Buffer-load boundaries have no semantic significance when
sending.  The contents of the data stream must match the data format expected
by the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> command; see
<a href="sql-copy.html">COPY</a> for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQputCopyEnd</tt><a name="id2614370"></a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p> Sends end-of-data indication to the server during <tt class="literal">COPY_IN</tt> state.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQputCopyEnd(PGconn *conn,
                 const char *errormsg);</pre>
<p>Ends the <tt class="literal">COPY_IN</tt> operation successfully if <i class="parameter"><tt>errormsg</tt></i>
is <tt class="symbol">NULL</tt>.  If <i class="parameter"><tt>errormsg</tt></i> is not <tt class="symbol">NULL</tt> then the <tt class="command">COPY</tt>
is forced to fail, with the string pointed to by <i class="parameter"><tt>errormsg</tt></i>
used as the error message.  (One should not assume that this exact error
message will come back from the server, however, as the server might have
already failed the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> for its own reasons.  Also note that the
option to force failure does not work when using pre-3.0-protocol connections.)</p>
<p>The result is 1 if the termination data was sent,
zero if it was not sent because the attempt would block (this case is only
possible if the connection is in nonblocking mode), or -1 if an error occurred.

<a name="libpq-copy-receive"></a>27.8.2. Functions for Receiving <tt class="command">COPY</tt> Data</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p> These functions are used to receive data during <tt class="literal">COPY TO STDOUT</tt>.
 They will fail if called when the connection is not in <tt class="literal">COPY_OUT</tt>
 state.</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQgetCopyData</tt><a name="id2614518"></a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p> Receives data from the server during <tt class="literal">COPY_OUT</tt> state.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQgetCopyData(PGconn *conn,
                  char **buffer,
                  int async);</pre>
<p>Attempts to obtain another row of data from the server during a <tt class="command">COPY</tt>.
Data is always returned one data row at a time; if only a partial row
is available, it is not returned.  Successful return of a data row
involves allocating a chunk of memory to hold the data.  The
<i class="parameter"><tt>buffer</tt></i> parameter must be non-<tt class="symbol">NULL</tt>.  <i class="parameter"><tt>*buffer</tt></i>
is set to point to the allocated memory, or to <tt class="symbol">NULL</tt> in cases where no
buffer is returned.  A non-<tt class="symbol">NULL</tt> result buffer must be freed using
<tt class="function">PQfreemem</tt> when no longer needed.</p>
<p>When a row is successfully returned, the return value is the number of
data bytes in the row (this will always be greater than zero).  The
returned string is always null-terminated, though this is probably only
useful for textual <tt class="command">COPY</tt>.  A result of zero indicates that the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> is
still in progress, but no row is yet available (this is only possible
when <i class="parameter"><tt>async</tt></i> is true).  A
result of -1 indicates that the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> is done.
A result of -2 indicates that an error occurred (consult
<tt class="function">PQerrorMessage</tt> for the reason).</p>
<p>When <i class="parameter"><tt>async</tt></i> is true (not zero), <tt class="function">PQgetCopyData</tt>
will not block waiting for input; it will return zero if the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> is still
in progress but no complete row is available.  (In this case wait for
read-ready before trying again; it does not matter whether you call
<tt class="function">PQconsumeInput</tt>.)  When <i class="parameter"><tt>async</tt></i> is
false (zero), <tt class="function">PQgetCopyData</tt> will block until data is available
or the operation completes.</p>
<p>After <tt class="function">PQgetCopyData</tt> returns -1, call
<tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt> to obtain the final result status of the
<tt class="command">COPY</tt> command.  One may wait for
this result to be available in the usual way.  Then return to normal
operation.</p>

<a name="libpq-copy-deprecated"></a>27.8.3. Obsolete Functions for <tt class="command">COPY</tt></h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p> These functions represent older methods of handling <tt class="command">COPY</tt>.
 Although they still work, they are deprecated due to poor error handling,
 inconvenient methods of detecting end-of-data, and lack of support for binary
 or nonblocking transfers.</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQgetline</tt><a name="id2614723"></a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>          Reads  a  newline-terminated  line  of  characters
          (transmitted  by the server) into a buffer
          string of size <i class="parameter"><tt>length</tt></i>.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQgetline(PGconn *conn,
              char *buffer,
              int length);</pre>
<p>This function copies up to <i class="parameter"><tt>length</tt></i>-1 characters
into the buffer and converts
the terminating newline into a zero byte.
<tt class="function">PQgetline</tt> returns <tt class="symbol">EOF</tt> at the end of input, 0 if the
entire line has been read, and 1 if the buffer is full but the
terminating newline has not yet been read.</p>
<p>Note that the application must check to see if a
new line consists of  the  two characters  <tt class="literal">\.</tt>,
which  indicates  that the server has finished sending
the results  of  the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> command.
If  the  application might
receive lines that are more than <i class="parameter"><tt>length</tt></i>-1  characters  long,
care is needed to be sure it recognizes the <tt class="literal">\.</tt> line correctly
(and does not, for example, mistake the end of a long data line
for a terminator line).</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQgetlineAsync</tt><a name="id2614807"></a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>          Reads a row of <tt class="command">COPY</tt> data
          (transmitted  by the server) into a buffer
          without blocking.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQgetlineAsync(PGconn *conn,
                   char *buffer,
                   int bufsize);</pre>
<p>This function is similar to <tt class="function">PQgetline</tt>, but it can be used
by applications
that must read <tt class="command">COPY</tt> data asynchronously, that is, without blocking.
Having issued the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> command and gotten a <tt class="literal">PGRES_COPY_OUT</tt>
response, the
application should call <tt class="function">PQconsumeInput</tt> and
<tt class="function">PQgetlineAsync</tt> until the
end-of-data signal is detected.</p>
<p>Unlike <tt class="function">PQgetline</tt>, this function takes
responsibility for detecting end-of-data.</p>
<p>On each call, <tt class="function">PQgetlineAsync</tt> will return data if a
complete data row is available in <span class="application">libpq</span>'s input buffer.
Otherwise, no data is returned until the rest of the row arrives.
The function returns -1 if the end-of-copy-data marker has been recognized,
or 0 if no data is available, or a positive number giving the number of
bytes of data returned.  If -1 is returned, the caller must next call
<tt class="function">PQendcopy</tt>, and then return to normal processing.</p>
<p>The data returned will not extend beyond a data-row boundary.  If possible
a whole row will be returned at one time.  But if the buffer offered by
the caller is too small to hold a row sent by the server, then a partial
data row will be returned.  With textual data this can be detected by testing
whether the last returned byte is <tt class="literal">\n</tt> or not.  (In a binary
<tt class="command">COPY</tt>, actual parsing of the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> data format will be needed to make the
equivalent determination.)
The returned string is not null-terminated.  (If you want to add a
terminating null, be sure to pass a <i class="parameter"><tt>bufsize</tt></i> one smaller
than the room actually available.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQputline</tt><a name="id2614951"></a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sends  a  null-terminated  string  to  the server.
Returns 0 if OK and <tt class="symbol">EOF</tt> if unable to send the string.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQputline(PGconn *conn,
              const char *string);</pre>
<p>The <tt class="command">COPY</tt> data stream sent by a series of calls to
<tt class="function">PQputline</tt> has the same format as that returned by
<tt class="function">PQgetlineAsync</tt>, except that applications are not
obliged to send exactly one data row per <tt class="function">PQputline</tt>
call; it is okay to send a partial line or multiple lines per call.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Before <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> protocol 3.0, it was necessary
for the application to explicitly send the two characters
<tt class="literal">\.</tt> as a final line to indicate to the server that it had
finished sending <tt class="command">COPY</tt> data.  While this still works, it is deprecated and the
special meaning of <tt class="literal">\.</tt> can be expected to be removed in a
future release.  It is sufficient to call <tt class="function">PQendcopy</tt> after
having sent the actual data.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQputnbytes</tt><a name="id2615045"></a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sends  a  non-null-terminated  string  to  the server.
Returns 0 if OK and <tt class="symbol">EOF</tt> if unable to send the string.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQputnbytes(PGconn *conn,
                const char *buffer,
                int nbytes);</pre>
<p>This is exactly like <tt class="function">PQputline</tt>, except that the data
buffer need not be null-terminated since the number of bytes to send is
specified directly.  Use this procedure when sending binary data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><tt class="function">PQendcopy</tt><a name="id2615084"></a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p> Synchronizes with the server.
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">int PQendcopy(PGconn *conn);</pre>
<p>
 This function waits until
 the  server  has  finished  the copying.  It should
 either be issued when the  last  string  has  been
 sent  to  the  server using <tt class="function">PQputline</tt> or when the
 last string has been  received  from  the  server
 using <tt class="function">PGgetline</tt>.  It must be issued or the server
 will get &#8220;<span class="quote">out of sync</span>&#8221; with  the client.   Upon
 return from this function, the server is ready to
 receive the next SQL command.
 The return value is 0  on  successful  completion,
 nonzero otherwise.  (Use <tt class="function">PQerrorMessage</tt> to retrieve
 details if the return value is nonzero.)</p>
<p>When using <tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt>, the application should respond to
a <tt class="literal">PGRES_COPY_OUT</tt> result by executing <tt class="function">PQgetline</tt>
repeatedly, followed by <tt class="function">PQendcopy</tt> after the terminator line is seen.
It should then return to the <tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt> loop until
<tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt> returns a null pointer. Similarly a <tt class="literal">PGRES_COPY_IN</tt>
result is processed by a series of <tt class="function">PQputline</tt> calls followed by
<tt class="function">PQendcopy</tt>, then return to the <tt class="function">PQgetResult</tt> loop.
This arrangement will ensure that
a <tt class="command">COPY</tt> command embedded in a series of <span class="acronym">SQL</span> commands
will be executed correctly.</p>
<p>Older applications are likely to submit a <tt class="command">COPY</tt>
via <tt class="function">PQexec</tt> and assume that the transaction is done after
<tt class="function">PQendcopy</tt>.
This will work correctly only if the <tt class="command">COPY</tt> is the only
<span class="acronym">SQL</span> command in the command string.</p>
