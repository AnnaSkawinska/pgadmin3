<a name="id2705009"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> reclaims storage occupied by deleted tuples.
   In normal <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> operation, tuples that
   are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from
   their table; they remain present until a <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> is
   done.  Therefore it's necessary to do <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt>
   periodically, especially on frequently-updated tables.
  </p>
<p>   With no parameter, <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> processes every table in the
   current database.  With a parameter, <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> processes
   only that table.
  </p>
<p>   <tt class="command">VACUUM ANALYZE</tt> performs a <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt>
   and then an <tt class="command">ANALYZE</tt> for each selected table.  This
   is a handy combination form for routine maintenance scripts.  See
   <a href="sql-analyze.html">ANALYZE</a>
   for more details about its processing.
  </p>
<p>   Plain <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> (without <tt class="literal">FULL</tt>) simply reclaims
   space and makes it
   available for re-use.  This form of the command can operate in parallel
   with normal reading and writing of the table, as an exclusive lock
   is not obtained. <tt class="command">VACUUM
   FULL</tt> does more extensive processing, including moving of tuples
   across blocks to try to compact the table to the minimum number of disk
   blocks.  This form is much slower and requires an exclusive lock on each
   table while it is being processed.
  </p>
<p>   <tt class="literal">FREEZE</tt> is a special-purpose option that
   causes tuples to be marked &#8220;<span class="quote">frozen</span>&#8221; as soon as possible,
   rather than waiting until they are quite old.  If this is done when there
   are no other open transactions in the same database, then it is guaranteed
   that all tuples in the database are &#8220;<span class="quote">frozen</span>&#8221; and will not be
   subject to transaction ID wraparound problems, no matter how long the
   database is left unvacuumed.
   <tt class="literal">FREEZE</tt> is not recommended for routine use.  Its only
   intended usage is in connection with preparation of user-defined template
   databases, or other databases that are completely read-only and will not
   receive routine maintenance <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> operations.
   See <a href="maintenance.html" title="Chapter 21. Routine Database Maintenance Tasks">Chapter 21, <i>Routine Database Maintenance Tasks</i></a> for details.

<a name="id2705244"></a><h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>    When <tt class="literal">VERBOSE</tt> is specified, <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> emits
    progress messages to indicate which table is currently being
    processed.  Various statistics about the tables are printed as well.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2705265"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>    We recommend that active production databases be
    vacuumed frequently (at least nightly), in order to
    remove expired rows. After adding or deleting a large number
    of rows, it may be a good idea to issue a <tt class="command">VACUUM
    ANALYZE</tt> command for the affected table. This will update the
    system catalogs with
    the results of all recent changes, and allow the
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> query planner to make better
    choices in planning queries.
   </p>
<p>    The <tt class="option">FULL</tt> option is not recommended for routine use,
    but may be useful in special cases.  An example is when you have deleted
    most of the rows in a table and would like the table to physically shrink
    to occupy less disk space.  <tt class="command">VACUUM FULL</tt> will usually
    shrink the table more than a plain <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> would.
