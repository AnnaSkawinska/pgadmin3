<div></div>

<p>    Since some of the tests inherently produce platform-specific
    results, we have provided a way to supply platform-specific result
    comparison files.  Frequently, the same variation applies to
    multiple platforms; rather than supplying a separate comparison
    file for every platform, there is a mapping file that defines
    which comparison file to use.  So, to eliminate bogus test
    &#8220;<span class="quote">failures</span>&#8221; for a particular platform, you must choose
    or make a variant result file, and then add a line to the mapping
    file, which is <tt class="filename">src/test/regress/resultmap</tt>.
   </p>
<p>    Each line in the mapping file is of the form
</p>
<pre class="synopsis">testname/platformpattern=comparisonfilename</pre>
<p>
    The test name is just the name of the particular regression test
    module.  The platform pattern is a pattern in the style of the Unix
    tool <tt class="command">expr</tt> (that is, a regular expression with an implicit
    <tt class="literal">^</tt> anchor
    at the start).  It is matched against the platform name as printed
    by <tt class="command">config.guess</tt> followed by
    <tt class="literal">:gcc</tt> or <tt class="literal">:cc</tt>, depending on
    whether you use the GNU compiler or the system's native compiler
    (on systems where there is a difference).  The comparison file
    name is the name of the substitute result comparison file.
   </p>
<p>    For example: some systems interpret very small floating-point values
    as zero, rather than reporting an underflow error.  This causes a
    few differences in the <tt class="filename">float8</tt> regression test.
    Therefore, we provide a variant comparison file,
    <tt class="filename">float8-small-is-zero.out</tt>, which includes
    the results to be expected on these systems.  To silence the bogus
    &#8220;<span class="quote">failure</span>&#8221; message on <span class="systemitem">OpenBSD</span>
    platforms, <tt class="filename">resultmap</tt> includes
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">float8/i.86-.*-openbsd=float8-small-is-zero</pre>
<p>
    which will trigger on any machine for which the output of
    <tt class="command">config.guess</tt> matches <tt class="literal">i.86-.*-openbsd</tt>.
    Other lines
    in <tt class="filename">resultmap</tt> select the variant comparison file for other
    platforms where it's appropriate.
   </p>
