<a name="id2572799"></a><a name="id2572805"></a><p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports basic table
    partitioning. This section describes why and how you can implement
    partitioning as part of your database design.

<p>    Partitioning refers to splitting what is logically one large table
    into smaller physical pieces.
    Partitioning can provide several benefits:
   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      Query performance can be improved dramatically for certain kinds
      of queries.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Update performance can be improved too, since each piece of the table
      has indexes smaller than an index on the entire data set would be.
      When an index no longer fits easily
      in memory, both read and write operations on the index take
      progressively more disk accesses.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Bulk deletes may be accomplished by simply removing one of the
      partitions, if that requirement is planned into the partitioning design.
      <code class="command">DROP TABLE</code> is far faster than a bulk <code class="command">DELETE</code>,
      to say nothing of the ensuing <code class="command">VACUUM</code> overhead.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Seldom-used data can be migrated to cheaper and slower storage media.
     </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>

    The benefits will normally be worthwhile only when a table would
    otherwise be very large. The exact point at which a table will
    benefit from partitioning depends on the application, although a
    rule of thumb is that the size of the table should exceed the physical
    memory of the database server.
   </p>
<p>    Currently, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports partitioning
    via table inheritance.  Each partition must be created as a child
    table of a single parent table.  The parent table itself is normally
    empty; it exists just to represent the entire data set.  You should be
    familiar with inheritance (see <a href="ddl-inherit.html" title="5.8. Inheritance">Section 5.8, &#8220;Inheritance&#8221;</a>) before
    attempting to implement partitioning.
   </p>
<p>    The following forms of partitioning can be implemented in
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>:

    </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">Range Partitioning</span></dt>
<dd><p>        The table is partitioned into &#8220;<span class="quote">ranges</span>&#8221; defined
        by a key column or set of columns, with no overlap between
        the ranges of values assigned to different partitions.  For
        example one might partition by date ranges, or by ranges of
        identifiers for particular business objects.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">List Partitioning</span></dt>
<dd><p>        The table is partitioned by explicitly listing which key values
        appear in each partition.
       </p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>

    Hash partitioning is not currently supported.

<a name="ddl-partitioning-implementation"></a>5.9.2. Implementing Partitioning</h3></div></div></div>
<p>     To set up a partitioned table, do the following:
     </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1" compact>
<li>
<p>        Create the &#8220;<span class="quote">master</span>&#8221; table, from which all of the
        partitions will inherit.
       </p>
<p>        This table will contain no data.  Do not define any check
        constraints on this table, unless you intend them to
        be applied equally to all partitions.  There is no point
        in defining any indexes or unique constraints on it, either.
       </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        Create several &#8220;<span class="quote">child</span>&#8221; tables that each inherit from
        the master table.  Normally, these tables will not add any columns
        to the set inherited from the master.
       </p>
<p>        We will refer to the child tables as partitions, though they
        are in every way normal <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> tables.
       </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        Add table constraints to the partition tables to define the
        allowed key values in each partition.
       </p>
<p>        Typical examples would be:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CHECK ( x = 1 )
CHECK ( county IN ( 'Oxfordshire', 'Buckinghamshire', 'Warwickshire' ))
CHECK ( outletID &gt;= 100 AND outletID &lt; 200 )</pre>
<p>
        Ensure that the constraints guarantee that there is no overlap
        between the key values permitted in different partitions.  A common
        mistake is to set up range constraints like this:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CHECK ( outletID BETWEEN 100 AND 200 )
CHECK ( outletID BETWEEN 200 AND 300 )</pre>
<p>
        This is wrong since it is not clear which partition the key value
        200 belongs in.
       </p>
<p>        Note that there is no difference in
        syntax between range and list partitioning; those terms are
        descriptive only.
       </p>
</li>
<li><p>        For each partition, create an index on the key column(s),
        as well as any other indexes you might want.  (The key index is
        not strictly necessary, but in most scenarios it is helpful.
        If you intend the key values to be unique then you should
        always create a unique or primary-key constraint for each
        partition.)
       </p></li>
<li><p>        Optionally, define a rule or trigger to redirect modifications
        of the master table to the appropriate partition.
       </p></li>
<li><p>        Ensure that the <a href="runtime-config-query.html#guc-constraint-exclusion">constraint_exclusion</a>
        configuration
        parameter is enabled in <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>.  Without
        this, queries will not be optimized as desired.
       </p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>
    </p>
<p>     For example, suppose we are constructing a database for a large
     ice cream company. The company measures peak temperatures every
     day as well as ice cream sales in each region. Conceptually,
     we want a table like this:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE measurement (
    city_id         int not null,
    logdate         date not null,
    peaktemp        int,
    unitsales       int
);</pre>
<p>

     We know that most queries will access just the last week's, month's or
     quarter's data, since the main use of this table will be to prepare
     online reports for management.
     To reduce the amount of old data that needs to be stored, we
     decide to only keep the most recent 3 years worth of data. At the
     beginning of each month we will remove the oldest month's data.
    </p>
<p>     In this situation we can use partitioning to help us meet all of our
     different requirements for the measurements table. Following the
     steps outlined above, partitioning can be set up as follows:
    </p>
<p>     </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1" compact>
<li><p>        The master table is the <code class="structname">measurement</code> table, declared
        exactly as above.
       </p></li>
<li>
<p>        Next we create one partition for each active month:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE measurement_yy04mm02 ( ) INHERITS (measurement);
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy04mm03 ( ) INHERITS (measurement);
...
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy05mm11 ( ) INHERITS (measurement);
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy05mm12 ( ) INHERITS (measurement);
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy06mm01 ( ) INHERITS (measurement);</pre>
<p>

        Each of the partitions are complete tables in their own right,
        but they inherit their definition from the
        <code class="structname">measurement</code> table.
       </p>
<p>        This solves one of our problems: deleting old data. Each
        month, all we will need to do is perform a <code class="command">DROP
        TABLE</code> on the oldest child table and create a new
        child table for the new month's data.
       </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        We must add non-overlapping table constraints, so that our
        table creation script becomes:

 </p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE measurement_yy04mm02 (
    CHECK ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2004-02-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2004-03-01' )
) INHERITS (measurement);
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy04mm03 (
    CHECK ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2004-03-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2004-04-01' )
) INHERITS (measurement);
...
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy05mm11 (
    CHECK ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2005-11-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2005-12-01' )
) INHERITS (measurement);
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy05mm12 (
    CHECK ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2005-12-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2006-01-01' )
) INHERITS (measurement);
CREATE TABLE measurement_yy06mm01 (
    CHECK ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-01-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2006-02-01' )
) INHERITS (measurement);</pre>
<p>
       </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        We probably need indexes on the key columns too:

 </p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE INDEX measurement_yy04mm02_logdate ON measurement_yy04mm02 (logdate);
CREATE INDEX measurement_yy04mm03_logdate ON measurement_yy04mm03 (logdate);
...
CREATE INDEX measurement_yy05mm11_logdate ON measurement_yy05mm11 (logdate);
CREATE INDEX measurement_yy05mm12_logdate ON measurement_yy05mm12 (logdate);
CREATE INDEX measurement_yy06mm01_logdate ON measurement_yy06mm01 (logdate);</pre>
<p>

        We choose not to add further indexes at this time.
       </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        If data will be added only to the latest partition, we can
        set up a very simple rule to insert data. We must
        redefine this each month so that it always points to the
        current partition.

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE OR REPLACE RULE measurement_current_partition AS
ON INSERT TO measurement
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_yy06mm01 VALUES ( NEW.city_id,
                                              NEW.logdate,
                                              NEW.peaktemp,
                                              NEW.unitsales );</pre>
<p>

        We might want to insert data and have the server automatically
        locate the partition into which the row should be added. We
        could do this with a more complex set of rules as shown below.

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE RULE measurement_insert_yy04mm02 AS
ON INSERT TO measurement WHERE
    ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2004-02-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2004-03-01' )
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_yy04mm02 VALUES ( NEW.city_id,
                                              NEW.logdate,
                                              NEW.peaktemp,
                                              NEW.unitsales );
...
CREATE RULE measurement_insert_yy05mm12 AS
ON INSERT TO measurement WHERE
    ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2005-12-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2006-01-01' )
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_yy05mm12 VALUES ( NEW.city_id,
                                              NEW.logdate,
                                              NEW.peaktemp,
                                              NEW.unitsales );
CREATE RULE measurement_insert_yy06mm01 AS
ON INSERT TO measurement WHERE
    ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-01-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2006-02-01' )
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_yy06mm01 VALUES ( NEW.city_id,
                                              NEW.logdate,
                                              NEW.peaktemp,
                                              NEW.unitsales );</pre>
<p>

        Note that the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause in each rule
        exactly matches the the <code class="literal">CHECK</code>
        constraint for its partition.
       </p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>
    </p>
<p>     As we can see, a complex partitioning scheme could require a
     substantial amount of DDL. In the above example we would be
     creating a new partition each month, so it may be wise to write a
     script that generates the required DDL automatically.
    </p>
<p>    The following caveats apply:
   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      There is currently no way to verify that all of the
      <code class="literal">CHECK</code> constraints are mutually
      exclusive. Care is required by the database designer.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      There is currently no simple way to specify that rows must not be
      inserted into the master table. A <code class="literal">CHECK (false)</code>
      constraint on the master table would be inherited by all child
      tables, so that cannot be used for this purpose.  One possibility is
      to set up an <code class="literal">ON INSERT</code> trigger on the master table that
      always raises an error.  (Alternatively, such a trigger could be
      used to redirect the data into the proper child table, instead of
      using a set of rules as suggested above.)
     </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    Partitioning can also be arranged using a <code class="literal">UNION ALL</code>
    view:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE VIEW measurement AS
          SELECT * FROM measurement_yy04mm02
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_yy04mm03
...
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_yy05mm11
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_yy05mm12
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_yy06mm01;</pre>
<p>

    However, constraint exclusion is currently not supported for
    partitioned tables defined in this manner.  Also, the need to
    recreate the view adds an extra step to adding and dropping
    individual partitions of the dataset.
   </p>

<a name="id2573361"></a><p>    <em class="firstterm">Constraint exclusion</em> is a query optimization technique
    that improves performance for partitioned tables defined in the
    fashion described above.  As an example:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET constraint_exclusion = on;
SELECT count(*) FROM measurement WHERE logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-01-01';</pre>
<p>

    Without constraint exclusion, the above query would scan each of
    the partitions of the <code class="structname">measurement</code> table. With constraint
    exclusion enabled, the planner will examine the constraints of each
    partition and try to prove that the partition need not
    be scanned because it could not contain any rows meeting the query's
    <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause.  When the planner can prove this, it
    excludes the partition from the query plan.
   </p>
<p>    You can use the <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> command to show the difference
    between a plan with <code class="varname">constraint_exclusion</code> on and a plan
    with it off.  A typical default plan for this type of table setup is:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET constraint_exclusion = off;
EXPLAIN SELECT count(*) FROM measurement WHERE logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-01-01';

                                          QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=158.66..158.68 rows=1 width=0)
   -&gt;  Append  (cost=0.00..151.88 rows=2715 width=0)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2006-01-01'::date)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement_yy04mm02 measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2006-01-01'::date)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement_yy04mm03 measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2006-01-01'::date)
...
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement_yy05mm12 measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2006-01-01'::date)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement_yy06mm01 measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2006-01-01'::date)</pre>
<p>

    Some or all of the partitions might use index scans instead of
    full-table sequential scans, but the point here is that there
    is no need to scan the older partitions at all to answer this query.
    When we enable constraint exclusion, we get a significantly
    reduced plan that will deliver the same answer:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET constraint_exclusion = on;
EXPLAIN SELECT count(*) FROM measurement WHERE logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-01-01';
                                          QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=63.47..63.48 rows=1 width=0)
   -&gt;  Append  (cost=0.00..60.75 rows=1086 width=0)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2006-01-01'::date)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on measurement_yy06mm01 measurement  (cost=0.00..30.38 rows=543 width=0)
               Filter: (logdate &gt;= '2006-01-01'::date)</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    Note that constraint exclusion is driven only by <code class="literal">CHECK</code>
    constraints, not by the presence of indexes.  Therefore it isn't
    necessary to define indexes on the key columns.  Whether an index
    needs to be created for a given partition depends on whether you
    expect that queries that scan the partition will generally scan
    a large part of the partition or just a small part.  An index will
    be helpful in the latter case but not the former.
   </p>
<p>    The following caveats apply:

   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      Constraint exclusion only works when the query's <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
      clause contains constants.  A parameterized query will not be
      optimized, since the planner cannot know what partitions the
      parameter value might select at runtime.  For the same reason,
      &#8220;<span class="quote">stable</span>&#8221; functions such as <code class="function">CURRENT_DATE</code>
      must be avoided.  Joining the partition key to a column of another
      table will not be optimized, either.
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Avoid cross-datatype comparisons in the <code class="literal">CHECK</code>
      constraints, as the planner will currently fail to prove such
      conditions false.  For example, the following constraint
      will work if <code class="varname">x</code> is an <code class="type">integer</code>
      column, but not if <code class="varname">x</code> is a
      <code class="type">bigint</code>:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CHECK ( x = 1 )</pre>
<p>
      For a <code class="type">bigint</code> column we must use a constraint like:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CHECK ( x = 1::bigint )</pre>
<p>
      The problem is not limited to the <code class="type">bigint</code> data type
      [mdash ] it can occur whenever the default data type of the
      constant does not match the data type of the column to which it
      is being compared.  Cross-datatype comparisons in the supplied
      queries are usually OK, just not in the <code class="literal">CHECK</code> conditions.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      <code class="command">UPDATE</code> and <code class="command">DELETE</code> commands
      against the master table do not currently perform constraint exclusion.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      All constraints on all partitions of the master table are considered for
      constraint exclusion, so large numbers of partitions are likely to
      increase query planning time considerably.
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Don't forget that you still need to run <code class="command">ANALYZE</code>
      on each partition individually. A command like
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">ANALYZE measurement;</pre>
<p>
      will only process the master table.
     </p>
