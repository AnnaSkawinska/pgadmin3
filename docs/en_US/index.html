<H3>pgAdmin III</H3>
<P>pgAdmin III is a comprehensive <A HREF="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL
database</A> design and management system for *nix and Windows
systems. It is freely available under the terms of the <A HREF="licence.html">Artistic
Licence</A> and may be redistributed provided the terms of the
licence are adhered to. The project is managed by the <A HREF="team.html">pgAdmin
Development Team</A>.</P>
<P>This software was written as a successor to the original pgAdmin
and pgAdmin II products, which though popular, had limitations in the
design that prevented them being taken to the 'next level'. pgAdmin
III is written in C++ and uses the excellent <A
HREF="www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</A> (formerly wxWindows)
cross platform toolkit. Connection to PostgreSQL is made using the
native libpq library.</P>
