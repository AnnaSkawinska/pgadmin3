<H3>pgAgent Jobs</H3>
<P>pgAgent runs 'jobs', each of which consists of 
<a href="pgagent-steps.html">steps</a> and 
<a href="pgagent-schedules.html">schedules</a>. To configure jobs on your
server, browse to the database in which the pgAgent database objects
were created using pgAdmin. A <I>Jobs</I> node will be displayed, under 
which individual jobs are shown. New jobs may be created, and existing
jobs modified in the same way as any other object in pgAdmin.</P>

<P>The properties tab in the main pgAdmin window will display the 
details of the selected job, and the Statistics tab will show the 
details of each run of the job.</P>

<P>Job themselves are very simple - the complexity is in the steps and
schedules. When configuring a job, we specify the job name, whether or
not it is enabled, a job class or category, and optionally the hostname
of a specific machine running pgAgent, if this job should only run on
that specific server. If left empty, any server may run the job. This
is not normally an issue for SQL-only jobs, however any jobs with
batch/shell steps may need to be targetted to a specific server. A
comment may also be included.</P>
