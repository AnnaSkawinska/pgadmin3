<H3>Connect errors</H3>

<p>
When connecting to a PostgreSQL server, you might get error messages that need
some more explanations. If you encounter them, please read the following information
carefully, we're sure they will help you.
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="hints/conn-listen.html">could not connect to Server: Connection refused</a>
<li><a href="hints/conn-hba.html">FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry</a>
</ul>
<br>
</p>
<H3 id="notrunning">could not connect to Server: Connection refused</H3>
<center><img src="images/not-running.png"></center>
<p>
If this message appears, there are two possible reasons for this: either the server isn't 
running at all. Simply start it.
</p>
<p>
The other non-trivial cause for this message is that the server isn't configured 
to accept TCP/IP requests on the address shown.
</p>
<p>
For security reasons, a PostgreSQL server &quot;out of the box&quot; doesn't listen on TCP/IP ports.
Instead, it has to be enabled to listen for TCP/IP requests. This can be done by 
adding <b>tcpip = true</b> to the postgresql.conf file for Versions 7.3.x and 7.4.x, or 
<b>listen_addresses='*'</b> for Version 8.0.x and above; this will make the server
accept connections on any IP interface.
</p>
<p>
For further information, please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation about
<a href="pg/runtime-config.html">runtime configuration</a>.<br>
</p>
<br>
<H3 id="no-hba">FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry</H3>
<center><img src="images/no-hba.png"></center>
<p>
If this message appears, your server can be contacted correctly over the network,
but isn't configured to accept your connection. Your client isn't detected 
as a legal user for the database.
</p>
<p>
You will have to add an entry in the form
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>host template1 postgres 192.168.0.0/24 md5</b>
<br>for IPV4 or 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>host template1 postgres ::ffff:192.168.0.0/120 md5</b>
<br>for IPV6 networks to the 
pg_hba.conf file.
