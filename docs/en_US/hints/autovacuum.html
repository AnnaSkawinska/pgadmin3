<h3>Running pg_autovacuum recommended</h3>
<p>
Introduced in PostgreSQL 8.1, the pg_autovacuum process which was previously 
implemented as an external service process is now integrated into the backend. It will
run VACUUM automatically if a configurable amount of data has changed.
</p>
<p>
Running VACUUM is mandatory on a PostgreSQL server to keep data consistent 
and the server performant. As a start, it is recommended to enable the pg_autovacuum 
daemon by setting 'autovacuum', 'stats_start_collector' and 'stats_row_level' 
in postgresql.conf to 'on'. With a usually neglectable performance penalty from the
data change tracking, you will gain automatic performing VACUUM runs.
</p>
<p>
To adjust pg_autovacuum performance for individual needs, you might need to tune
its settings using global parameters in postgresql.conf, or individually on each table; see
the documentation.
