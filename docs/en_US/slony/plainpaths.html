<p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> uses <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> DSNs in three contexts to establish
access to databases:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> <a href="admconninfo.html" title="ADMIN CONNINFO"><span class="refentrytitle">ADMIN CONNINFO</span></a> - controlling how a
<a href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> script accesses the various nodes.</p>
<p> These connections are the ones that go from your
&#8220;<span class="quote">administrative workstation</span>&#8221; to all of the nodes in a <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
cluster.</p>
<p> It is <span class="emphasis"><em>vital</em></span> that you have connections from the
central location where you run <a href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> 
to each and every node in the network.  These connections are only
used briefly, to submit the few <span class="acronym">SQL</span> requests required to
control the administration of the cluster.</p>
<p> Since these communications paths are only used briefly, it may
be quite reasonable to &#8220;<span class="quote">hack together</span>&#8221; temporary
connections using <a href="requirements.html#tunnelling">SSH
tunnelling</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> DSN parameter. </p>
<p> The DSN parameter passed to each <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a>
indicates what network path should be used to get from the slon
process to the database that it manages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <a href="stmtstorepath.html" title="STORE
     PATH"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE
     PATH</span></a> - controlling how
<a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> daemons communicate with remote nodes.  These
paths are stored in <a href="table.sl-path.html">sl_path</a>.</p>
<p> You forcibly <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to have a path between
each subscriber node and its provider; other paths are optional, and
will not be used unless a listen path in <a href="table.sl-listen.html">sl_listen</a>. is needed that uses that particular
path.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p> The distinctions and possible complexities of paths are not
normally an issue for people with simple networks where all the hosts
can see one another via a comparatively &#8220;<span class="quote">global</span>&#8221; set of
network addresses.  In contrast, it matters rather a lot for those
with complex firewall configurations, nodes at multiple locations, and
the issue where nodes may not be able to all talk to one another via a
uniform set of network addresses.</p>
<p> Consider the attached diagram, which describes a set of six
nodes

<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="complexenv.png" alt=" Symmetric Multisites "></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> DB1 and DB2 are databases residing in a secure
&#8220;<span class="quote">database layer,</span>&#8221; firewalled against outside access
except from specifically controlled locations.</p>
<p> Let's suppose that DB1 is the origin node for the replication
system.</p>
</li>
<li><p> DB3 resides in a &#8220;<span class="quote">DMZ</span>&#8221; at the same site;
it is intended to be used as a <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> &#8220;<span class="quote">provider</span>&#8221; for
remote locations.</p></li>
<li><p> DB4 is a counterpart to DB3 in a &#8220;<span class="quote">DMZ</span>&#8221;
at a secondary/failover site.  Its job, in the present configuration,
is to &#8220;<span class="quote">feed</span>&#8221; servers in the secure database layers at the
secondary site.</p></li>
<li>
<p> DB5 and and DB6 are counterparts to DB1 and DB2, but
are, at present, configured as subscribers.</p>
<p> Supposing disaster were to strike at the &#8220;<span class="quote">primary</span>&#8221;
site, the secondary site would be well-equipped to take over servicing
the applications that use this data.</p>
<p> Managers paying bills are likely to be reluctant to let the
machines at the secondary site merely be &#8220;<span class="quote">backups;</span>&#8221; they
would doubtless prefer for them to be useful, and that can certainly
be the case.  If the primary site is being used for
&#8220;<span class="quote">transactional activities,</span>&#8221; the replicas at the secondary
site may be used for running time-oriented reports that do not require
up-to-the second data.</p>
</li>
<li><p> The symmetry of the configuration means that if you
had <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> transactional applications needing
protection from failure, it would be straightforward to have
additional replication sets so that each site is normally
&#8220;<span class="quote">primary</span>&#8221; for one application, and where destruction of
one site could be addressed by consolidating services at the remaining
site.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p></p>
<p> There is also room for discussion of SSH tunnelling
here...</p>
