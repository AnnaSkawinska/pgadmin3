Functions </h2></div></div></div>
<p> There are cases where it may make sense to directly use the
stored functions that implement the various pieces of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>.
Slonik doesn't do terribly much &#8220;<span class="quote">magic;</span>&#8221; it is common for
Slonik commands to simply involve deciding on a node at which to apply
a command, and then submit a SQL query consisting of a call to one of
the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> stored functions.</p>
<p> The developers of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> anticipate that interested parties
may wish to develop graphical tools as an alternative to Slonik; it
would be entirely appropriate in such cases to submit configuration
requests directly via the stored functions.  If you plan to do so, it
is suggested that you examine how the stored procedures get used in
<code class="filename">slonik.c</code>, as that should be the most
representative way of seeing correct use of the functions.</p>
<p> When debugging problems in &#8220;<span class="quote">troubled</span>&#8221; <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
clusters, it has also occasionally proven useful to use the stored
functions.  This has been particularly useful for cases where <a href="table.sl-listen.html">sl_listen</a> configuration has been broken, and events
have not been propagating properly.  The &#8220;<span class="quote">easiest</span>&#8221; fix
was to:</p>
<p> <code class="command"> select
_slonycluster.droplisten(li_origin,li_provider,li_receiver) from
_slonycluster.sl_listen;</code></p>
<p> <code class="command"> select _slonycluster.storelisten(pa_server,
pa_server, pa_client) from _slonycluster.sl_path;</code></p>
<p> The result of this set of queries is to regenerate
<span class="emphasis"><em>and propagate</em></span> the listen paths.  By running the main
<code class="function"> _slonycluster.storelisten()</code> function,
<code class="command">STORE_LISTEN</code> events are raised to cause the listen paths to
propagate to the other nodes in the cluster.</p>
<p> If there was a <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> problem on one node, and you
didn't want the updates to propagate (this would be an unusual
situation; you almost certainly want to fix things
<span class="emphasis"><em>everywhere</em></span>), the queries would instead be:</p>
<p> <code class="command"> select
slonycluster.droplisten_int(li_origin,li_provider,li_receiver) from
_slonycluster.sl_listen;</code></p>
<p> <code class="command"> select _slonycluster.storelisten_int(pa_server,
pa_server, pa_client) from _slonycluster.sl_path;</code></p>
<p> If you are planning to add <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> support to other tools
(<span class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span> - adding replication support to something
like <a href="http://www.pgadmin.org/" target="_top"> <span class="productname">pgAdmin
III</span> </a>), you need to be clear on where various
functions need to be called.  The normal &#8220;<span class="quote">protocol</span>&#8221; is
thus:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> The &#8220;<span class="quote">main</span>&#8221; function
(<span class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span> - without the <code class="command">_int</code>
suffix) is called on a &#8220;<span class="quote">relevant</span>&#8221; node in the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
cluster.</p>
<p> In some cases, the function may be called on any node, and it
can satisfactorily propagate to other nodes.  That is true for <a href="function.storelisten-integer-integer-integer.html">schemadocstorelisten( integer, integer, integer )</a>, for instance.
In other cases, the function needs to be called on some particular
node because that is the only place where data may be reasonably
validated.  For instance, <a href="function.subscribeset-integer-integer-integer-boolean.html">schemadocsubscribeset( integer, integer, integer, boolean )</a> must
be called on the receivernode.</p>
</li>
<li><p> If that &#8220;<span class="quote">main</span>&#8221; function succeeds, then
the configuration change is performed on the local node, and an event
is created using <a href="function.createevent-name-text.html">schemadoccreateevent( name, text )</a> to
cause the configuration change to propagate to all of the other nodes
in the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> cluster.</p></li>
<li>
<p> Thirdly, the <code class="command">_int</code> version of the
function must be run.</p>
<p> In some cases, where functions are idempotent, the node where
the &#8220;<span class="quote">main</span>&#8221; function runs can do this fairly early in
processing.</p>
<p> When the event propagates, the other nodes will run the
<code class="command">_int</code> version, we rather hope with good
success. </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
