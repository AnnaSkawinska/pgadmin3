<a name="id2596579"></a><p> A number of people have found
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> useful for helping perform upgrades
between major <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> releases
(<span class="emphasis"><em> e.g.</em></span> which mandates running
<span class="application">initdb</span> to create a new database instance)
without requiring a substantial downtime.</p>
<p> The &#8220;<span class="quote">simple</span>&#8221; way that one might imagine doing such
an upgrade would involve running <span class="application">pg_dump</span> on
the database running the older version, and then submit the results
into a <span class="application">psql</span> session connected to a database
instance running the newer version.  Unfortunately, the time consumed
from start to end, for this approach, may be prohibitive.  For a
database containing 40GB of data with numerous indices, the process
required involves:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> Stop all applications that might modify the data</p></li>
<li><p> Start the <span class="application">pg_dump</span>, and load that into the new database</p></li>
<li><p> Wait 40 hours for the dump/load to complete</p></li>
<li><p> Point &#8220;<span class="quote">write</span>&#8221; applications to the new database</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> And note that this led to a 40 hour outage.</p>
<p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> offers an opportunity to replace that long outage with
one a few minutes or even a few seconds long.  The approach taken is
to create a <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> replica in the new version.  It is possible that
it might take much longer than 40h to create that replica, but once
it's there, it can be kept very nearly up to date.</p>
<p> When it is time to switch over to the new database, the
procedure is rather less time consuming:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> Stop all applications that might modify the data</p></li>
<li><p> Lock the set against client application updates using
<a class="xref" href="stmtlockset.html" title="LOCK SET"><span class="refentrytitle">LOCK SET</span></a></p></li>
<li><p> Submit the Slonik command <a class="xref" href="stmtmoveset.html" title="MOVE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MOVE SET</span></a> to shift the origin from the old database to
the new one</p></li>
<li><p> Point the applications at the new database</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> This procedure should only need to take a very short time,
likely bound more by how quickly you can reconfigure your applications
than anything else.  If you can automate all the steps, it might take
less than a second.  If not, somewhere between a few seconds and a few
minutes is likely.</p>
<p> Note that after the origin has been shifted, updates now flow
into the <span class="emphasis"><em>old</em></span> database.  If you discover that due
to some unforeseen, untested condition, your application is somehow
unhappy connecting to the new database, you could easily use <a class="xref" href="stmtmoveset.html" title="MOVE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MOVE SET</span></a> again to shift the origin back to the old
database.</p>
<p> If you consider it particularly vital to be able to shift back
to the old database in its state at the time of the changeover, so as
to be able to outright roll back the whole change, and would like as
well the ability to shift back to the old version (with any updates
since the changeover), the following steps would accomplish that:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Prepare <span class="emphasis"><em> two </em></span> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> replicas
of the database:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle">
<li><p> One running the new version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span></p></li>
<li><p> One running the old version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span></p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> Thus, you have <span class="emphasis"><em>three</em></span> nodes, one running
the new version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, and the other two the old version.</p>
</li>
<li><p> Once they are roughly &#8220;<span class="quote">in sync</span>&#8221;, stop
all applications that might modify the data</p></li>
<li>
<p> Allow them to get in sync, then
<code class="command">stop</code> the <span class="application">slon</span> daemon
that has been feeding the subscriber running the old version of
<span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span></p>
<p> You may want to use <a class="xref" href="stmtuninstallnode.html" title="UNINSTALL NODE"><span class="refentrytitle">UNINSTALL NODE</span></a> to
decommission this node, making it into a standalone database, or
merely kill the <span class="application">slon</span>, depending on how
permanent you want this all to be.</p>
</li>
<li><p> Then use <a class="xref" href="stmtmoveset.html" title="MOVE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MOVE SET</span></a> to shift the
origin, as before.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> Supposing a &#8220;<span class="quote">small</span>&#8221; disaster strikes, you might
recover back to the node running the old database that has been seeing
updates come through; if you run into larger problems, you would have
to abandon the two nodes and go to the one which had been shut off.</p>
<p> This isn't to say that it is routine to have the sorts of
problems that would mandate such a &#8220;<span class="quote">paranoid</span>&#8221; procedure;
people worried about process risk assessments can be reassured if you
have choices like this.

<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does not support versions of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> older
than 7.3.3 because it needs namespace support that did not solidify
until that time.  Rod Taylor &#8220;<span class="quote">hacked up</span>&#8221; a version of
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> to work on 7.2 by allowing the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> objects to live in
the global schema.  He found it pretty fiddly, and that some queries
weren't very efficient (the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> query optimizer has improved
<span class="emphasis"><em>considerably</em></span> since 7.2), but that this was more
workable for him than other replication systems such as
<span class="productname">eRServer</span>.  If you desperately need that,
look for him on the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> Hackers mailing list.  It is not
anticipated that 7.2 will be supported by any official <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
release.</p>
