<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p> If you are running version
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> 1.1 or later it should be
<span class="emphasis"><em>completely unnecessary</em></span> to read this section as it
introduces a way to automatically manage this part of its
configuration.  For earlier versions, however, it is needful.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have more than two or three nodes, and any degree of
usage of cascaded subscribers (<span class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span> - subscribers
that are subscribing through a subscriber node), you will have to be
fairly careful about the configuration of &#8220;<span class="quote">listen paths</span>&#8221;
via the Slonik <a href="stmtstorelisten.html" title="STORE LISTEN"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE LISTEN</span></a> and <a href="stmtdroplisten.html" title="DROP LISTEN"><span class="refentrytitle">DROP LISTEN</span></a> statements that control the contents of the
table <a href="table.sl-listen.html">sl_listen</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<span class="quote">listener</span>&#8221; entries in this table control where
each node expects to listen in order to get events propagated from
other nodes.  You might think that nodes only need to listen to the
&#8220;<span class="quote">parent</span>&#8221; from whom they are getting updates, but in
reality, they need to be able to receive messages from
<span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> nodes in order to be able to conclude that
<code class="command">sync</code>s have been received everywhere, and that,
therefore, entries in <a href="table.sl-log-1.html">sl_log_1</a> and <a href="table.sl-log-2.html">sl_log_2</a> have been applied everywhere, and can
therefore be purged.  this extra communication is needful so
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is able to shift origins to other
locations.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id518475"></a>8.1. How listening can break</h3></div></div></div>
<p>On one occasion, I had a need to drop a subscriber node (#2) and
recreate it.  That node was the data provider for another subscriber
(#3) that was, in effect, a &#8220;<span class="quote">cascaded slave.</span>&#8221; Dropping
the subscriber node initially didn't work, as <a href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a>
informed me that there was a dependant node.  I repointed the
dependant node to the &#8220;<span class="quote">master</span>&#8221; node for the subscription
set, which, for a while, replicated without difficulties.</p>
<p>I then dropped the subscription on &#8220;<span class="quote">node 2</span>&#8221;, and
started resubscribing it.  that raised the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
<code class="command">set_subscription</code> event, which started copying
tables.  at that point in time, events stopped propagating to
&#8220;<span class="quote">node 3</span>&#8221;, and while it was in perfectly ok shape, no
events were making it to it.</p>
<p>The problem was that node #3 was expecting to receive events
from node #2, which was busy processing the <code class="command">set_subscription</code>
event, and was not passing anything else on.</p>
<p>We dropped the listener rules that caused node #3 to listen to
node 2, replacing them with rules where it expected its events to come
from node #1 (the origin node for the replication set).  At that
moment, &#8220;<span class="quote">as if by magic</span>&#8221;, node #3 started replicating again, as
it discovered a place to get <code class="command">sync</code> events.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id518560"></a>8.2. How the listen configuration should look</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The simple cases tend to be simple to cope with.  We need to
instead look at a more complex node configuration.</p>
<p>Consider a set of nodes, 1 thru 6, where 1 is the origin, 
where 2-4 subscribe directly to the origin, and where 5 subscribes to
2, and 6 subscribes to 5.</p>
<p>Here is a &#8220;<span class="quote">listener network</span>&#8221; that indicates where each
node should listen for messages coming from each other node:

</p>
<pre class="screen">       1|   2|   3|   4|   5|   6|
--------------------------------------------
   1   0    2    3    4    2    2 
   2   1    0    1    1    5    5 
   3   1    1    0    1    1    1 
   4   1    1    1    0    1    1 
   5   2    2    2    2    0    6 
   6   5    5    5    5    5    0 </pre>
<p>Row 2 indicates all of the listen rules for node 2; it gets
events for nodes 1, 3, and 4 throw node 1, and gets events for nodes 5
and 6 from node 5.</p>
<p>The row of 5's at the bottom, for node 6, indicate that node 6
listens to node 5 to get events from nodes 1-5.</p>
<p>The set of slonik <code class="command">set listen</code> statements to express
this &#8220;<span class="quote">listener network</span>&#8221; are as follows:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">store listen (origin = 1, receiver = 2, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 1, receiver = 3, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 1, receiver = 4, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 1, receiver = 5, provider = 2);
store listen (origin = 1, receiver = 6, provider = 5);
store listen (origin = 2, receiver = 1, provider = 2);
store listen (origin = 2, receiver = 3, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 2, receiver = 4, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 2, receiver = 5, provider = 2);
store listen (origin = 2, receiver = 6, provider = 5);
store listen (origin = 3, receiver = 1, provider = 3);
store listen (origin = 3, receiver = 2, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 3, receiver = 4, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 3, receiver = 5, provider = 2);
store listen (origin = 3, receiver = 6, provider = 5);
store listen (origin = 4, receiver = 1, provider = 4);
store listen (origin = 4, receiver = 2, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 4, receiver = 3, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 4, receiver = 5, provider = 2);
store listen (origin = 4, receiver = 6, provider = 5);
store listen (origin = 5, receiver = 1, provider = 2);
store listen (origin = 5, receiver = 2, provider = 5);
store listen (origin = 5, receiver = 3, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 5, receiver = 4, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 5, receiver = 6, provider = 5);
store listen (origin = 6, receiver = 1, provider = 2);
store listen (origin = 6, receiver = 2, provider = 5);
store listen (origin = 6, receiver = 3, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 6, receiver = 4, provider = 1);
store listen (origin = 6, receiver = 5, provider = 6);</pre>
<p>How we read these listen statements is thus...</p>
<p>When on the &#8220;<span class="quote">receiver</span>&#8221; node, look to the &#8220;<span class="quote">provider</span>&#8221;
node to provide events coming from the &#8220;<span class="quote">origin</span>&#8221; node.</p>
<p>The tool <code class="filename">init_cluster</code> in the
<code class="filename">altperl</code> scripts produces optimized listener
networks in both the tabular form shown above as well as in the form
of <a href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> statements.</p>
<p>There are three &#8220;<span class="quote">thorns</span>&#8221; in this set of roses:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> If you change the shape of the node set, so that the
nodes subscribe differently to things, you need to drop <a href="table.sl-listen.html">sl_listen</a> entries and create new ones to indicate the
new preferred paths between nodes.  Until <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>, there is no
automated way at this point to do this
&#8220;<span class="quote">reshaping</span>&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p> If you <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> change the
<a href="table.sl-listen.html">sl_listen</a> entries, events will likely continue to propagate so long as
all of the nodes continue to run well.  the problem will only be
noticed when a node is taken down, &#8220;<span class="quote">orphaning</span>&#8221; any nodes
that are listening through it.</p></li>
<li><p> you might have multiple replication sets that have
<span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> shapes for their respective trees of
subscribers.  there won't be a single &#8220;<span class="quote">best</span>&#8221; listener
configuration in that case.</p></li>
<li><p> In order for there to be an <a href="table.sl-listen.html">sl_listen</a> path, there <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be a
series of <a href="table.sl-path.html">sl_path</a> entries connecting the origin
to the receiver.  this means that if the contents of <a href="table.sl-path.html">sl_path</a> do not express a &#8220;<span class="quote">connected</span>&#8221;
network of nodes, then some nodes will not be reachable.  this would
typically happen, in practice, when you have two sets of nodes, one in
one subnet, and another in another subnet, where there are only a
couple of &#8220;<span class="quote">firewall</span>&#8221; nodes that can talk between the
subnets.  cut out those nodes and the subnets stop
communicating.</p></li>
</ul></div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="autolisten"></a>8.3. Automated Listen Path Generation</h3></div></div></div>
<p> In <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> version 1.1, a heuristic scheme is introduced to
automatically generate <code class="envar">sl_listen</code> entries.  This
happens, in order, based on three data sources:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> <a href="table.sl-subscribe.html">sl_subscribe</a> entries are the
first, most vital control as to what listens to what; we
<span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> there must be a direct path between each
subscriber node and its provider.</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="table.sl-path.html">sl_path</a> entries are the second
indicator; if <a href="table.sl-subscribe.html">sl_subscribe</a> has not already
indicated &#8220;<span class="quote">how to listen,</span>&#8221; then a node may listen
directly to the event's origin if there is a suitable <a href="table.sl-path.html">sl_path</a> entry.</p></li>
<li><p> Lastly, if there has been no guidance thus far based
on the above data sources, then nodes can listen indirectly via every
node that is either a provider for the receiver, or that is using the
receiver as a provider.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> Any time <a href="table.sl-subscribe.html">sl_subscribe</a> or <a href="table.sl-path.html">sl_path</a> are modified,
<code class="function">RebuildListenEntries()</code> will be called to revise
the listener paths.</p>
<p> If you are running an earlier version of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>, you may want
to take a look at <a href="altperl.html#regenlisten" title="18.25. regenerate-listens">Section 18.25, &#8220;regenerate-listens&#8221;</a>, a Perl script which
duplicates the functionality of the stored procedure in the form of a
script that generates the <a href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> requests to
generate the listener paths.</p>
