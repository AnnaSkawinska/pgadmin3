<a name="id2558822"></a><p>Before you subscribe a node to a set, be sure that you have
<a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> processes running for both the provider and the
new subscribing node. If you don't have slons running, nothing will
happen, and you'll beat your head against a wall trying to figure out
what is going on.</p>
<p>Subscribing a node to a set is done by issuing the <a href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> command <a href="stmtsubscribeset.html" title="SUBSCRIBE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">SUBSCRIBE SET</span></a>. It may
seem tempting to try to subscribe several nodes to a set within a
single try block like this:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">try {
  echo 'Subscribing sets';
  subscribe set (id = 1, provider=1, receiver=2, forward=yes);
  subscribe set (id = 1, provider=1, receiver=3, forward=yes);
  subscribe set (id = 1, provider=1, receiver=4, forward=yes);
} on error {
  echo 'Could not subscribe the sets!';
  exit -1;
}</pre>
<p> But you are just asking for trouble if you try to subscribe
sets in that fashion. The proper procedure is to subscribe one node at
a time, and to check the logs and databases before you move onto
subscribing the next node to the set. It is also worth noting that the
&#8220;<span class="quote">success</span>&#8221; within the above <a href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> try
block does not imply that nodes 2, 3, and 4 have all been successfully
subscribed. It merely indicates that the slonik commands were
successfully received by the <span class="application">slon</span> running
on the origin node.</p>
<p>A typical sort of problem that will arise is that a cascaded
subscriber is looking for a provider that is not ready yet.  In that
failure case, that subscriber node will <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span>
pick up the subscriber.  It will get &#8220;<span class="quote">stuck</span>&#8221; waiting for
a past event to take place.  The other nodes will be convinced that it
is successfully subscribed (because no error report ever made it back
to them); a request to unsubscribe the node will be
&#8220;<span class="quote">blocked</span>&#8221; because the node is stuck on the attempt to
subscribe it.</p>
<p>When you subscribe a node to a set, you should see something
like this in your <span class="application">slon</span> logs for the
provider node:

</p>
<pre class="screen">DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_3: Received event 3,1059 SUBSCRIBE_SET</pre>
<p>You should also start seeing log entries like this in the
<span class="application">slon</span> logs for the subscribing node:

</p>
<pre class="screen">DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_1: copy table public.my_table</pre>
<p>It may take some time for larger tables to be copied from the
provider node to the new subscriber. If you check the pg_stat_activity
table on the provider node, you should see a query that is copying the
table to stdout.</p>
<p>The table <code class="envar">sl_subscribe</code> on both the provider, and the new
subscriber should contain entries for the new subscription:

</p>
<pre class="screen"> sub_set | sub_provider | sub_receiver | sub_forward | sub_active
---------+--------------+--------------+-------------+------------
      1  |            1 |            2 |           t |         t</pre>
<p>A final test is to insert a row into one of the replicated
tables on the origin node, and verify that the row is copied to the
new subscriber.</p>
<div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Warning</h3>
<p> If you create and subscribe a set that does not
contain any tables, that can lead to a problem that will stop
replication from proceeding. </p>
<p> Note that this bug is addressed as of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> 1.1.5 </p>
<p> If a particular subscriber is only being fed sequences by one
of its providers, the query that collects <code class="command">SYNC</code>
event data will not be constructed correctly, and you will see error
messages similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="screen">2005-04-13 07:11:28 PDT ERROR remoteWorkerThread_11: "declare LOG
cursor for select log_origin, log_xid, log_tableid, log_actionseq,
log_cmdtype, log_cmddata from "_T1".sl_log_1 where log_origin = 11 and
( order by log_actionseq; " PGRES_FATAL_ERROR ERROR: syntax error at
or near "order" at character 162</pre>
<p> The function <a href="function.subscribeset-integer-integer-integer-boolean.html">schemadocsubscribeset( integer, integer, integer, boolean )</a> will
generate a warning if given a replication set that lacks any tables to
replicate, as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre class="screen">cbbrowne@dba2:/tmp&gt; cat create_empty_set.slonik
cluster name = T1;
node 11 admin conninfo = 'dbname=slony_test1';
node 22 admin conninfo = 'dbname=slony_test2';

create set (id = 255, origin = 11, comment='blank empty set');
subscribe set (id=255, provider = 11, receiver = 22, forward = false);</pre>
<p> This leads to the following warning message: </p>
<pre class="screen">bbrowne@dba2:/tmp&gt; slonik create_empty_set.slonik
create_empty_set.slonik:6: NOTICE:  subscribeSet:: set 255 has no tables
