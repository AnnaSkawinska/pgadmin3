Costs</h2></div></div></div>
<p>The cost of communications grows in a quadratic fashion in
several directions as the number of replication nodes in a cluster
increases.  Note the following relationships:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> It is necessary to have <a href="table.sl-listen.html">sl_listen</a> entries allowing connection from each node
to every other node.  Most will normally not need to be very heavily,
but it still means that there needs to be n(n-1) paths.</p></li>
<li><p> Each SYNC applied needs to be reported back to all of
the other nodes participating in the set so that the nodes all know
that it is safe to purge <a href="table.sl-log-1.html">sl_log_1</a> and <a href="table.sl-log-2.html">sl_log_2</a> data, as any &#8220;<span class="quote">forwarding</span>&#8221; node
could potentially take over as &#8220;<span class="quote">master</span>&#8221; at any time.  One
might expect SYNC messages to need to travel through n/2 nodes to get
propagated to their destinations; this means that each SYNC is
expected to get transmitted n(n/2) times.  Again, this points to a
quadratic growth in communications costs as the number of nodes
increases.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>This points to it being a bad idea to have the large
communications network resulting from the number of nodes being large.
Up to a half dozen nodes seems pretty reasonable; every time the
number of nodes doubles, this can be expected to quadruple
communications overheads.</p>
