<a name="maintenance"></a>5. <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> Maintenance</h2></div></div></div>
<p><span class="productname">Slony-I</span> actually does a lot of its necessary maintenance
itself, in a &#8220;<span class="quote">cleanup</span>&#8221; thread:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> Deletes old data from various tables in the
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> cluster's namespace, notably
entries in <a href="table.sl-log-1.html">sl_log_1</a>, <a href="table.sl-log-2.html">sl_log_2</a> (not yet used), and <a href="table.sl-seqlog.html">sl_seqlog</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p> Vacuum certain tables used by <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>.  As of 1.0.5,
this includes pg_listener; in earlier versions, you must vacuum that
table heavily, otherwise you'll find replication slowing down because
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> raises plenty of events, which leads to that table having
plenty of dead tuples.</p>
<p> In some versions (1.1, for sure; possibly 1.0.5) there is the
option of not bothering to vacuum any of these tables if you are using
something like <span class="application">pg_autovacuum</span> to handle
vacuuming of these tables.  Unfortunately, it has been quite possible
for <span class="application">pg_autovacuum</span> to not vacuum quite
frequently enough, so you probably want to use the internal vacuums.
Vacuuming <code class="envar">pg_listener</code> &#8220;<span class="quote">too often</span>&#8221; isn't
nearly as hazardous as not vacuuming it frequently enough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have long-running transactions, vacuums
cannot clear out dead tuples that are newer than the eldest
transaction that is still running.  This will most notably lead to
<code class="envar">pg_listener</code> growing large and will slow
replication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <a href="faq.html#dupkey"> Duplicate Key Violation</a> bug has helped track down some <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> race conditions.
One remaining issue is that it appears that is a case where
<code class="command">VACUUM</code> is not reclaiming space correctly, leading
to corruption of B-trees. </p>
<p> It may be helpful to run the command <code class="command"> REINDEX TABLE
sl_log_1;</code> periodically to avoid the problem
occurring. </p>

<a name="id517055"></a>5.1.  Watchdogs: Keeping Slons Running</h3></div></div></div>
<p>There are a couple of &#8220;<span class="quote">watchdog</span>&#8221; scripts available that
monitor things, and restart the <span class="application">slon</span> processes should
they happen to die for some reason, such as a network &#8220;<span class="quote">glitch</span>&#8221;
that causes loss of connectivity.</p>
<p>You might want to run them...</p>

<a name="id517083"></a>5.2. Parallel to Watchdog: generate_syncs.sh</h3></div></div></div>
<p>A new script for <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> 1.1 is
<span class="application">generate_syncs.sh</span>, which addresses the following kind of
situation.</p>
<p>Supposing you have some possibly-flakey server where the
<span class="application">slon</span> daemon that might not run all the time, you might
return from a weekend away only to discover the following situation.</p>
<p>On Friday night, something went &#8220;<span class="quote">bump</span>&#8221; and while the
database came back up, none of the <span class="application">slon</span> daemons
survived.  Your online application then saw nearly three days worth of
reasonably heavy transaction load.</p>
<p>When you restart <span class="application">slon</span> on Monday, it
hasn't done a SYNC on the master since Friday, so that the next
&#8220;<span class="quote">SYNC set</span>&#8221; comprises all of the updates between Friday
and Monday.  Yuck.</p>
<p>If you run <span class="application">generate_syncs.sh</span> as a cron job every
20 minutes, it will force in a periodic <code class="command">SYNC</code> on the origin, which
means that between Friday and Monday, the numerous updates are split
into more than 100 syncs, which can be applied incrementally, making
the cleanup a lot less unpleasant.</p>
<p>Note that if <code class="command">SYNC</code>s <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> running
regularly, this script won't bother doing anything.</p>

<a name="id517183"></a>5.3. Replication Test Scripts </h3></div></div></div>
<p> In the directory <code class="filename">tools</code> may be found four
scripts that may be used to do monitoring of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> instances:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> <code class="command">test_slony_replication</code> is a
Perl script to which you can pass connection information to get to a
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> node.  It then queries <a href="table.sl-path.html">sl_path</a> and
other information on that node in order to determine the shape of the
requested replication set.</p>
<p> It then injects some test queries to a test table called
<code class="envar">slony_test</code> which is defined as follows, and which needs to be
added to the set of tables being replicated:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE slony_test (
    description text,
    mod_date timestamp with time zone,
    "_Slony-I_testcluster_rowID" bigint DEFAULT nextval('"_testcluster".sl_rowid_seq'::text) NOT NULL
);</pre>
<p> The last column in that table was defined by <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> as one
lacking a primary key...</p>
<p> This script generates a line of output for each <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> node
that is active for the requested replication set in a file called
<code class="filename">cluster.fact.log</code>.</p>
<p> There is an additional <code class="option">finalquery</code> option that allows
you to pass in an application-specific SQL query that can determine
something about the state of your application.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="command">log.pm</code> is a Perl module that manages logging
for the Perl scripts.</p></li>
<li>
<p><code class="command">run_rep_tests.sh</code> is a &#8220;<span class="quote">wrapper</span>&#8221; script
that runs <code class="command">test_slony_replication</code>.</p>
<p> If you have several <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> clusters, you might set up
configuration in this file to connect to all those
clusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="command">nagios_slony_test</code> is a script
that was constructed to query the log files so that you might run the
replication tests every so often (we run them every 6 minutes), and
then a system monitoring tool such as <a href="http://www.nagios.org/" target="_top"> <span class="productname">Nagios</span></a> can be set up to use this script to query the state indicated
in those logs.</p>
<p> It seemed rather more efficient to have a
<span class="application">cron</span> job run the tests and have
<span class="productname">Nagios</span> check the results rather than having
<span class="productname">Nagios</span> run the tests directly.  The tests
can exercise the whole <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> cluster at once rather than
<span class="productname">Nagios</span> invoking updates over and over
again.</p>

<p><a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> daemons generate some more-or-less verbose
log files, depending on what debugging level is turned on.  You might
assortedly wish to:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> Use a log rotator like <span class="productname">Apache</span> 
<span class="application">rotatelogs</span> to have a sequence of log files so that no
one of them gets too big;</p></li>
<li><p> Purge out old log files, periodically.</p></li>
