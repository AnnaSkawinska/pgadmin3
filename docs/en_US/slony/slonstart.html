<p>The programs that actually perform <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> replication are the
<span class="application">slon</span> daemons.</p>
<p>You need to run one <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> instance for each node
in a <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> cluster, whether you consider that node a
&#8220;<span class="quote">master</span>&#8221; or a &#8220;<span class="quote">slave</span>&#8221;. On <span class="trademark">Windows</span>&#8482; when
running as a service things are slightly different. One slon service
is installed, and a seperate configuration file registered for each
node to be serviced by that machine. The main service then manages the
individual slons itself. Since a <code class="command">MOVE SET</code> or
<code class="command">FAILOVER</code> can switch the roles of nodes, slon needs
to be able to function for both providers and subscribers.  It is not
essential that these daemons run on any particular host, but there are
some principles worth considering:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> Each <span class="application">slon</span> needs to be able
to communicate quickly with the database whose &#8220;<span class="quote">node
controller</span>&#8221; it is.  Therefore, if a <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> cluster runs
across some form of Wide Area Network, each slon process should run on
or nearby the databases each is controlling.  If you break this rule,
no particular disaster should ensue, but the added latency introduced
to monitoring events on the slon's &#8220;<span class="quote">own node</span>&#8221; will cause
it to replicate in a <span class="emphasis"><em>somewhat</em></span> less timely
manner.</p></li>
<li><p> The very fastest results would be achieved by having
each <span class="application">slon</span> run on the database server that
it is servicing.  If it runs somewhere within a fast local network,
performance will not be noticeably degraded.</p></li>
<li><p> It is an attractive idea to run many of the
<span class="application">slon</span> processes for a cluster on one
machine, as this makes it easy to monitor them both in terms of log
files and process tables from one location.  This also eliminates the
need to login to several hosts in order to look at log files or to
restart <span class="application">slon</span> instances.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>There are two &#8220;<span class="quote">watchdog</span>&#8221; scripts currently available:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> <code class="filename">tools/altperl/slon_watchdog</code> -
an &#8220;<span class="quote">early</span>&#8221; version that basically wraps a loop around the
invocation of <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a>, restarting any time it falls
over</p></li>
<li><p> <code class="filename">tools/altperl/slon_watchdog2</code>
- a somewhat more intelligent version that periodically polls the
database, checking to see if a <code class="command">SYNC</code> has taken place
recently.  We have had VPN connections that occasionally fall over
without signalling the application, so that the <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a>
stops working, but doesn't actually die; this polling addresses that
issue.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>The <code class="filename">slon_watchdog2</code> script is probably
<span class="emphasis"><em>usually</em></span> the preferable thing to run.  It was at
one point not preferable to run it whilst subscribing a very large
replication set where it is expected to take many hours to do the
initial <code class="command">COPY SET</code>.  The problem that came up in that
case was that it figured that since it hasn't done a
<code class="command">SYNC</code> in 2 hours, something was broken requiring
restarting slon, thereby restarting the <code class="command">COPY SET</code>
event.  More recently, the script has been changed to detect
<code class="command">COPY SET</code> in progress.</p>
