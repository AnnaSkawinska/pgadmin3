<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<div class="cmdsynopsis"><p><code class="command">SUBSCRIBE SET (options);</code></p></div>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2592593"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p> This performs one of two actions: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Initiates replication for a replication set </p>
<p> Causes a node (subscriber) to start replicating a set of
    tables either from the origin or from another provider node, which
    must itself already be be an active, forwarding subscriber.</p>
<p> The application tables contained in the set must already
     exist and should ideally be empty. The current version of
     <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
     attempt to copy the schema of the set. The replication daemon will
     start copying the current content of the set from the given
     provider and then try to catch up with any update activity that
     happened during that copy process. After successful subscription,
     the tables are guarded on the subscriber, using triggers, against
     accidental updates by the application.
    </p>
<p> If the tables on the subscriber are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> empty, then
     the <code class="command">COPY SET</code> process winds up doing more work than should be
     strictly necessary:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle">
<li><p> It deletes all &#8220;<span class="quote">old</span>&#8221; entries in
      the table</p></li>
<li><p> Those old entries
	clutter up the table until it is next
	<code class="command">VACUUM</code>ed <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the
	subscription process is complete</p></li>
<li><p> The indices for the table will contain entries
	for the old, deleted entries, which will slow the process of
	inserting new entries into the index.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Warning</h3>
<p> This operation can take a (potentially distinctly)
     non-zero period of time.  If you have a great deal of data in a
     particular set of tables, it may take hours or even (if &#8220;<span class="quote">a
     great deal</span>&#8221; indicates &#8220;<span class="quote">tens or hundreds gigabytes of
     data</span>&#8221;) possibly multiple days for this event to
     complete.</p>
<p> The <code class="command">SUBSCRIBE SET</code> request will,
     nonetheless, return fairly much immediately, even though the work
     is merely &#8220;<span class="quote">in progress.</span>&#8221; If you need to set up
     subscriptions for a set of cascading nodes, you will need to wait
     for each subscriber to complete subscribing before submitting
     requests for subscriptions that use that node as a provider.  If
     you don't, it won't be a big deal: <code class="command">slonik</code> will
     check the node, discover that it is not yet an active provider
     for the set, and report back:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"> Slony-I: provider 2 is not an active forwarding node for replication set 1</pre>
<p> In effect, such subscription requests will be ignored
     until the provider is ready.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p> Revising subscription information for already-subscribed nodes. </p>
<p> If you need to revise subscription information for a
       node, you <span class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> submit the new information
       using this command, and the new configuration will be propagated
       throughout the replication network.  The normal reason to revise
       this information is that you want a node to subscribe to a
       <span class="emphasis"><em> different </em></span> provider node, or for a node to
       become a &#8220;<span class="quote">forwarding</span>&#8221; subscriber so it may later
       become the provider for a later subscriber.</p>
</li>

<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2592804"></a><h2>Example</h2>
<pre class="programlisting">SUBSCRIBE SET (
   ID = 1,
   PROVIDER = 1,
   RECEIVER = 3,
   FORWARD = YES
);
    </pre>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2592814"></a><h2> Forwarding Behaviour </h2>
<p> The <code class="command">FORWARD=boolean</code> flag indicates
    whether the subscriber will store log information in tables
    <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a> and <a href="table.sl-log-2.html" title="1.6.  Table: sl_log_2">sl_log_2</a>.  Several implications fall from
    this...</p>
<p> By storing the data in these tables on the subscriber,
    there is some additional processing burden.  If you are certain
    that you would never want to <a href="stmtmoveset.html" title="MOVE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MOVE SET</span></a> or <a href="stmtfailover.html" title="FAILOVER"><span class="refentrytitle">FAILOVER</span></a> to a particular subscriber, it is worth
    considering turning off forwarding on that node.  </p>
<p> There is, however, a case where having forwarding turned
    off opens up a perhaps-unexpected failure condition; a rule of
    thumb should be that <span class="emphasis"><em>all nodes that connect directly to
    the origin</em></span> should have forwarding turned on.  Supposing
    one such &#8220;<span class="quote">direct subscriber</span>&#8221; has forwarding turned
    off, it is possible for that node to be forcibly lost in a case of
    failover.  The problem comes if that node gets ahead of other
    nodes.</p>
<p> Let's suppose that the origin, node 1 is at SYNC number
    88901, a non-forwarding node, node 2 has processed up to SYNC
    88897, and other forwarding nodes, 3, 4, and 5, have only
    processed data up to SYNC 88895.  At that moment, the disk system
    on the origin node catches fire.  Node 2 has the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>data</em></span> up to SYNC 88897, but there is no
    remaining node that contains, in <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a> or <a href="table.sl-log-2.html" title="1.6.  Table: sl_log_2">sl_log_2</a>, the data
    for SYNCs 88896 and 88897, so there is no way to bring nodes 3-5
    up to that point.</p>
<p> At that point, there are only two choices: To drop node 2,
    because there is no way to continue managing it, or to drop all
    nodes <span class="emphasis"><em>but</em></span> 2, because there is no way to bring
    them up to SYNC 88897.</p>
<p> That dilemma may be avoided by making sure that all nodes
    directly subscribing to the origin have forwarding turned
    on. </p>

<a name="id2592913"></a><h2> Dangerous/Unintuitive Behaviour </h2>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> The fact that the request returns immediately
     even though the subscription may take considerable time to
     complete may be a bit surprising. </p>
<p> Processing of the subscription involves
     <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> events; the
     <code class="command">SUBSCRIBE_SET</code>, initiated from the provider
     node, and an <code class="command">ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTION</code>, which is
     initiated on the subscriber node.  This means that <a href="stmtwaitevent.html" title="WAIT FOR EVENT"><span class="refentrytitle">WAIT FOR EVENT</span></a> cannot directly wait for completion of a
     subscription.  If you need to wait for completion of a
     subscription, then what you need to do instead is to submit a
     <a href="stmtsync.html" title="SYNC"><span class="refentrytitle">SYNC</span></a> request, and wait for
     <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> event.</p>
</li>
<li><p> This command has <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span>
     purposes; setting up subscriptions (which should be unsurprising)
     and <span class="emphasis"><em>revising subscriptions</em></span>, which isn't so
     obvious to intuition. </p></li>
<li><p> New subscriptions are set up by using
     <code class="command">DELETE</code> or <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> to
     empty the table on a subscriber.  If you created a new node by
     copying data from an existing node, it might &#8220;<span class="quote">seem
     intuitive</span>&#8221; that that data should be kept; that is not the
     case - the former contents are discarded and the node is
     populated <span class="emphasis"><em>from scratch</em></span>.</p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2593005"></a><h2> Locking Behaviour </h2>
<p> This operation does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> require
    acquiring any locks on the provider node.</p>
<p> On the subscriber node, it will have the effect of locking
    every table in the replication set.  In version 1.2, exclusive
    locks are acquired at the beginning of the process; in earlier
    versions, locks were acquired implicitly as activity mandated it,
    which left some risk of deadlock if other applications could
    access the subscriber database at this time.
