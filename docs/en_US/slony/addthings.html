<a name="id2591102"></a><p>You may discover that you have missed replicating things that
you wish you were replicating.</p>
<p>This can generally be fairly easily remedied.  This section
attempts to provide a &#8220;<span class="quote">task-oriented</span>&#8221; view of how to use
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span>; in effect, to answer the question &#8220;<span class="quote">How do I do
<span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> with <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>?</span>&#8221;, for various values of
<span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>.</p>
<p>You cannot directly use <a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> <a class="xref" href="stmtsetaddtable.html" title="SET ADD TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">SET ADD TABLE</span></a> or <a class="xref" href="stmtsetaddsequence.html" title="SET ADD SEQUENCE"><span class="refentrytitle">SET ADD SEQUENCE</span></a> in
order to add tables and sequences to a replication set that is
presently replicating; you must instead create a new replication set.
Once it is identically subscribed (e.g. - the set of providers and
subscribers is <span class="emphasis"><em>entirely identical</em></span> to that for the
set it is to merge with), the sets may be merged together using <a class="xref" href="stmtmergeset.html" title="MERGE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MERGE
     SET</span></a>.</p>
<p>Up to and including 1.0.2, there was a potential problem where
if <a class="xref" href="stmtmergeset.html" title="MERGE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MERGE
     SET</span></a> is issued while other
subscription-related events are pending, it is possible for things to
get pretty confused on the nodes where other things were pending.
This problem was resolved in 1.0.5.  Up until 1.2.1, there was still a
problem where <a class="xref" href="stmtmergeset.html" title="MERGE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MERGE
     SET</span></a> could be requested before
all the subscriptions were complete, which would &#8220;<span class="quote">muss things
up</span>&#8221; on nodes where subscription activity was still under
way. </p>
<p> Note that if you add nodes, you will need to add both <a class="xref" href="stmtstorepath.html" title="STORE PATH"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE
     PATH</span></a> statements to indicate how nodes communicate
with one another, and <a class="xref" href="stmtstorelisten.html" title="STORE LISTEN"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE LISTEN</span></a> statements to
configuration the &#8220;<span class="quote">communications network</span>&#8221; that results
from that.  See <a class="xref" href="listenpaths.html" title="9. Slony-I listen paths">Section 9, &#8220;Slony-I listen paths&#8221;</a> for more details on the
latter.</p>
<p>It is suggested that you be very deliberate when adding such
things.  For instance, submitting multiple subscription requests for a
particular set in one <a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> script often turns out
quite badly.  If it is <span class="emphasis"><em>truly</em></span> necessary to
automate this, you'll probably want to
submit <a class="xref" href="stmtwaitevent.html" title="WAIT FOR EVENT"><span class="refentrytitle">WAIT FOR EVENT</span></a> requests in between subscription
requests in order that the <a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> script wait for one
subscription to complete processing before requesting the next
one.</p>
<p>But in general, it is likely to be easier to cope with complex
node reconfigurations by making sure that one change has been
successfully processed before going on to the next.  It's way easier
to fix one thing that has broken than to piece things together after
the interaction of five things that have all broken.</p>
<p> Here are a set of &#8220;<span class="quote">recipes</span>&#8221; for how to do various
sorts of modifications to replication configuration:</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2591275">12.1.  Adding a table to replication </h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2591279"></a><p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does not allow you to add a table to a replication set
that is already being replicated. In principle, it would certainly be
<span class="emphasis"><em>possible;</em></span> what would happen is that the
SET_ADD_TABLE event would lead to the relevant code from the
SUBSCRIBE_SET event being invoked to initialize the table. That would,
regrettably, significantly complicate the logic of all of these
components, so this is not permitted. </p>
<p>Instead, what you must do is thus:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Add the new table on each node. </p>
<p> In principle, <a class="xref" href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a> could be used for
this, but the fact that this leads to <a class="link" href="locking.html" title="11. Locking Issues"> Locking
Issues </a> and requires altering <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> tables
in some existing replication set, on <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> nodes,
makes <a class="xref" href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a> an unattractive approach on a
busy system.  This breaks the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> feature that you &#8220;<span class="quote">don't
have to interrupt normal activity to introduce replication.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p> Instead, you may add the table via
<span class="application">psql</span> on each node.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Create a new replication set <a class="xref" href="stmtcreateset.html" title="CREATE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE SET</span></a></p></li>
<li><p> 
Add the table to the new set <a class="xref" href="stmtsetaddtable.html" title="SET ADD TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">SET ADD TABLE</span></a> </p></li>
<li><p> Request subscription <a class="xref" href="stmtsubscribeset.html" title="SUBSCRIBE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">SUBSCRIBE SET</span></a> for this new set. If there are several
nodes, you will need to <a class="xref" href="stmtsubscribeset.html" title="SUBSCRIBE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">SUBSCRIBE SET</span></a> once for
each node that should subscribe.  </p></li>
<li>
<p> If you wish to know, deterministically, that each
subscription has completed, you'll need to submit the following sort
of slonik script for each subscription:

</p>
<pre class="screen">SUBSCRIBE SET (ID=1, PROVIDER=1, RECEIVER=2);
WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN=2, CONFIRMED = 1);
SYNC(ID = 1);
WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN=1, CONFIRMED=2);</pre>
</li>
<li><p> Once the subscriptions have all been set up so that
the new set has an identical set of subscriptions to the old set, you
can merge the new set in alongside the old one via <a class="xref" href="stmtmergeset.html" title="MERGE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MERGE
     SET</span></a> </p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2591422">12.2.  How to add columns to a replicated table </h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id2591426"></a><p> This also answers the question &#8220;<span class="quote">How do I rename columns
on a replicated table?</span>&#8221;, and, more generally, other questions
to the effect of &#8220;<span class="quote">How do I modify the definitions of replicated
tables?</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>If you change the &#8220;<span class="quote">shape</span>&#8221; of a replicated table,
this needs to take place at exactly the same point in all of the
&#8220;<span class="quote">transaction streams</span>&#8221; on all nodes that are subscribed to
the set containing the table.</p>
<p> Thus, the way to do this is to construct an SQL script
consisting of the DDL changes, and then submit that script to all of
the nodes via the Slonik command <a class="xref" href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a>.</p>
<p> Alternatively, if you have the <a class="link" href="adminscripts.html#altperl" title="19.1. altperl Scripts"> altperl
scripts </a> installed, you may use
<code class="command">slonik_execute_script</code> for this purpose: </p>
<p> <code class="command"> slonik_execute_script [options] set#
full_path_to_sql_script_file </code></p>
<p> See <code class="command">slonik_execute_script -h</code> for further
options; note that this uses <a class="xref" href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a>
underneath. </p>
<p> There are a number of &#8220;<span class="quote">sharp edges</span>&#8221; to note...</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> You absolutely <span class="emphasis"><em>must not</em></span> include
transaction control commands, particularly <code class="command">BEGIN</code>
and <code class="command">COMMIT</code>, inside these DDL scripts. <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
wraps DDL scripts with a <code class="command">BEGIN</code>/<code class="command">COMMIT</code> 
pair; adding extra transaction control will mean that parts of the DDL
will commit outside the control of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> </p></li>
<li>
<p> Before version 1.2, it was necessary to be
exceedingly restrictive about what you tried to process using
<a class="xref" href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a>. </p>
<p> You could not have anything <code class="command">'quoted'</code> in the
script, as this would not be stored and forwarded properly.  As of
1.2, quoting is now handled properly. </p>
<p> If you submitted a series of DDL statements, the later ones
could not make reference to objects created in the earlier ones, as
the entire set of statements was submitted as a single query, where
the query plan was based on the state of the database at
the <span class="emphasis"><em>beginning,</em></span> before any modifications had been
made.  As of 1.2, if there are 12 SQL statements, they are each
submitted individually, so that <code class="command"> alter table x add column c1
integer; </code> may now be followed by <code class="command"> alter table x
alter column c1 set not null; </code>.</p>
</li>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2591606">12.3.  How to remove replication for a node</h3></div></div></div>
<p> You will want to remove the various <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> components
connected to the database(s).</p>
<p> We will just consider, for now, doing this to one node. If you
have multiple nodes, you will have to repeat this as many times as
necessary.</p>
<p> Components to be Removed: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> Log Triggers / Update Denial Triggers
</p></li>
<li><p> The &#8220;<span class="quote">cluster</span>&#8221; schema containing <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
tables indicating the state of the node as well as various stored
functions</p></li>
<li><p> <a class="xref" href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> process that manages the node </p></li>
<li><p> Optionally, the SQL and pl/pgsql scripts and <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
binaries that are part of the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> build. (Of course, this would
make it challenging to restart replication; it is unlikely that you
truly need to do this...)</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> How To Conveniently Handle Removal</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> You may use the Slonik <a class="xref" href="stmtdropnode.html" title="DROP NODE"><span class="refentrytitle">DROP NODE</span></a>
command to remove the node from the cluster. This will lead to the
triggers and everything in the cluster schema being dropped from the
node. The <a class="xref" href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> process will automatically die
off.</p></li>
<li>
<p> In the case of a failed node (where you
used <a class="xref" href="stmtfailover.html" title="FAILOVER"><span class="refentrytitle">FAILOVER</span></a> to switch to another node), you may
need to use <a class="xref" href="stmtuninstallnode.html" title="UNINSTALL NODE"><span class="refentrytitle">UNINSTALL NODE</span></a> to drop out the
triggers and schema and functions.</p>
<p> If the node failed due to some dramatic hardware failure
(<span class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span> disk drives caught fire), there may not be
a database left on the failed node; it would only be expected to
survive if the failure was one involving a network failure where
the <span class="emphasis"><em>database</em></span> was fine, but you were forced to
drop it from replication due to (say) some persistent network outage.</p>
</li>
<li><p> If the above things work out particularly badly, you
could submit the SQL command <code class="command">DROP SCHEMA "_ClusterName"
CASCADE;</code>, which will drop out <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> functions, tables,
and triggers alike.  That is generally less suitable
than <a class="xref" href="stmtuninstallnode.html" title="UNINSTALL NODE"><span class="refentrytitle">UNINSTALL NODE</span></a>, because that command not only
drops the schema and its contents, but also removes any columns
previously added in using <a class="xref" href="stmttableaddkey.html" title="TABLE ADD KEY"><span class="refentrytitle">TABLE ADD KEY</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2591761">12.4.  Adding A Node To Replication</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Things are not fundamentally different whether you are adding a
brand new, fresh node, or if you had previously dropped a node and are
recreating it. In either case, you are adding a node to
replication. </p>
<p>The needful steps are thus... </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Determine the node number and any relevant DSNs for
the new node.  Use <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> command <code class="command">createdb</code> to
create the database; add the table definitions for the tables that are
to be replicated, as <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does not automatically propagate that
information.</p>
<p> If you do not have a perfectly clean SQL script to add in the
tables, then run the tool <a class="link" href="adminscripts.html#extractschema" title="19.4.  slony1_extract_schema.sh"> <code class="command">slony1_extract_schema.sh</code> </a> from the
<code class="filename">tools</code> directory to get the user schema from the
origin node with all <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> &#8220;<span class="quote">cruft</span>&#8221; removed.  </p>
</li>
<li><p> If the node had been a failed node, you may need to
issue the <a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a>
command <a class="xref" href="stmtdropnode.html" title="DROP NODE"><span class="refentrytitle">DROP NODE</span></a> in order to get rid of its
vestiges in the cluster, and to drop out the schema that <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
creates.</p></li>
<li><p> Issue the slonik
command <a class="xref" href="stmtstorenode.html" title="STORE NODE"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE NODE</span></a> to establish the new node.</p></li>
<li><p> At this point, you may start a <a class="xref" href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> daemon against
the new node. It may not know much about the other nodes yet, so the
logs for this node may be pretty quiet.</p></li>
<li><p> Issue the slonik
command <a class="xref" href="stmtstorepath.html" title="STORE PATH"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE
     PATH</span></a> to indicate
how <a class="xref" href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> processes are to communicate with the new
node.  In <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> version 1.1 and later, this will then automatically
generate <a class="link" href="listenpaths.html" title="9. Slony-I listen paths"> listen path </a> entries; in
earlier versions, you will need to
use <a class="xref" href="stmtstorelisten.html" title="STORE LISTEN"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE LISTEN</span></a> to generate them manually.</p></li>
<li><p> At this point, it is an excellent idea to run
the <code class="filename">tools</code>
script <code class="command">test_slony_state-dbi.pl</code>, which rummages
through the state of the entire cluster, pointing out any anomalies
that it finds.  This includes a variety of sorts of communications
problems.</p></li>
<li><p> Issue the slonik
command <a class="xref" href="stmtsubscribeset.html" title="SUBSCRIBE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">SUBSCRIBE SET</span></a> to subscribe the node to
some replication set.</p></li>

<p> This isn't a case for <a class="xref" href="stmtmoveset.html" title="MOVE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MOVE SET</span></a>; we're not
shifting the origin, just reshaping the subscribers. </p>
<p> For this purpose, you can simply submit <a class="xref" href="stmtsubscribeset.html" title="SUBSCRIBE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">SUBSCRIBE SET</span></a> requests to <span class="emphasis"><em>revise</em></span>

<p> The ultimate proof is in looking at whether data added at the
origin makes it to the subscribers.  That's a &#8220;<span class="quote">simply matter of
querying</span>&#8221;.</p>
<p> There are several ways of examining replication status, however: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Look in the <a class="xref" href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> logs.</p>
<p> They won't say too much, even at very high debugging levels, on
an origin node; at debugging level 2, you should see, on subscribers,
that SYNCs are being processed.  As of version 1.2, the information
reported for SYNC processing includes counts of the numbers of tables
processed, as well as numbers of tuples inserted, deleted, and
updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Look in the view <code class="command"> sl_status </code>, on
the origin node. </p>
<p> This view will tell how far behind the various subscribing
nodes are in processing events from the node where you run the query.
It will only be <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> informative on a node that
originates a replication set.</p>
</li>
<li><p> Run the <code class="filename">tools</code>
script <code class="command">test_slony_state-dbi.pl</code>, which rummages
through the state of the entire cluster, pointing out any anomalies
that it notices, as well as some information on the status of each

<p> You must first pick a node that is connected to the former
origin (otherwise it is not straightforward to reverse connections in
the move to keep everything connected). </p>
<p> Second, you must run a <a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> script with the
command <a class="xref" href="stmtlockset.html" title="LOCK SET"><span class="refentrytitle">LOCK SET</span></a> to lock the set on the origin
node.  Note that at this point you have an application outage under
way, as what this does is to put triggers on the origin that rejects
updates. </p>
<p> Now, submit the <a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> <a class="xref" href="stmtmoveset.html" title="MOVE SET"><span class="refentrytitle">MOVE SET</span></a> request.
It's perfectly reasonable to submit both requests in the same
<a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a> script.  Now, the origin gets switched over to the new
origin node.  If the new node is a few events behind, it may take a
little while for this to take place. </p>

<p> The <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> notion of a <code class="command">SYNC</code> is actually
always an <span class="emphasis"><em>incremental</em></span> thing; a
<code class="command">SYNC</code> represents the set of updates that were
committed during the scope of a particular <code class="command">SYNC</code>
event on the origin node.  If a set of updates that altered the entire
contents of a table were committed in a single
<code class="command">SYNC</code>, that would affect the entire contents of the
table.  But as far as <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is concerned, this change is
&#8220;<span class="quote">incremental</span>&#8221; even though the increment happened to be
&#8220;<span class="quote">the whole table.</span>&#8221; </p>
<p> The only time that <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> &#8220;<span class="quote">synchronizes</span>&#8221; the
contents of a table is at the time the subscription is set up, at
which time it uses <code class="command">COPY</code> to draw in the entire
contents from the provider node.</p>
<p> Since subscriber tables are protected against modification by
anything other than <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>, there should be no way (aside from
horrible bugs) for tables to fall out of synchronization.  If they do,
there is some rather serious problem with <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>. </p>
<p> If some such severe corruption takes place, the answer is to
drop the table from replication, then create a new replication set and
add it back. </p>
