<a name="id2614703"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p> Executes a script containing arbitrary SQL statements on
     all nodes that are subscribed to a set at a common controlled
     point within the replication transaction stream.</p>
<p> The specified event origin must be the origin of the set.
    The script file must not contain any <code class="command">START</code> or
    <code class="command">COMMIT TRANSACTION</code> calls.  (This changes
    somewhat in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.0 once nested transactions, aka
    savepoints, are supported) In addition, non-deterministic DML
    statements (like updating a field with
    <code class="function">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code>) must be avoided, since the
    data changes done by the script are explicitly not
    replicated. </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal"> SET ID = ival </code></span></dt>
<dd><p> The unique numeric ID number of the set
      affected by the script</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal"> FILENAME = '/path/to/file' </code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p> The name of the file containing the SQL script to
	execute.  This might be a relative path, relative to the location of
	the <span class="application">slonik</span> instance you are running, or, preferably,
	an absolute path on the system where <span class="application">slonik</span> is to run.</p>
<p> The <span class="emphasis"><em>contents</em></span> of the file are propagated as part of
	the event, so the file does not need to be accessible on any of the
	nodes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal"> EVENT NODE = ival </code></span></dt>
<dd><p> (Optional) The ID of the current origin of the set.  Default value is 1.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal"> EXECUTE ONLY ON = ival

       </code></span></dt>
<dd><p> (Optional) The ID of the
       only node to actually execute the script.  This option causes
       the script to be executed, by <a class="xref" href="slonik.html" title="slonik"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slonik-title"></a><span class="application">slonik</span></span></a>,
       <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> on the one node specified.  The
       default is to execute the script on all nodes that are
       subscribed to the set.</p></dd>

<p> Note that this is a <a class="link" href="locking.html" title="11. Locking Issues"> locking </a> operation, which means that
    it can get stuck behind other database activity.</p>
<p> At the start of this event, all replicated tables are
    unlocked via the function
    <code class="function">alterTableRestore(tab_id)</code>.  After the SQL
    script has run, they are returned to &#8220;<span class="quote">replicating
    state</span>&#8221; using
    <code class="function">alterTableForReplication(tab_id)</code>.  This means
    that all of these tables are locked by this <a class="xref" href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> process for the
    duration of the SQL script execution.</p>
<p> If a table's columns are modified, it is very important
    that the triggers be regenerated, otherwise they may be
    inappropriate for the new form of the table schema.</p>
<p> Note that if you need to make reference to the cluster
    name, you can use the token <code class="command">@CLUSTERNAME@</code>; if
    you need to make reference to the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> namespace, you can use
    the token <code class="command">@NAMESPACE@</code>; both will be expanded
    into the appropriate replacement tokens. </p>

<a name="id2614913"></a><h2>Example</h2>
<pre class="programlisting">EXECUTE SCRIPT (
   SET ID = 1,
   FILENAME = '/tmp/changes_2004-05-01.sql',
   EVENT NODE = 1
);
    </pre>

<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2614922"></a><h2> Locking Behaviour </h2>
<p> Each replicated table receives an exclusive lock, on the
    origin node, in order to remove the replication triggers; after
    the DDL script completes, those locks will be cleared. </p>
<p> After the DDL script has run on the origin node, it will
    then run on subscriber nodes, where replicated tables will be
    similarly altered to remove replication triggers, therefore
    requiring that exclusive locks be taken out on each node, in
    turn. </p>

<a name="id2614937"></a><h2> Version Information </h2>
<p> This command was introduced in <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> 1.0. </p>
<p> Before <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> version 1.2, the entire DDL script was
    submitted as one <code class="function">PQexec()</code> request, with the
    implication that the <span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> script was parsed
    based on the state of the database before invokation of the
    script.  This means statements later in the script cannot depend
    on DDL changes made by earlier statements in the same script.
    Thus, you cannot add a column to a table and add constraints to
    that column later in the same request. </p>
<p> In <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> version 1.2, the DDL script is split into
    statements, and each statement is submitted separately.  As a
    result, it is fine for later statements to refer to objects or
    attributes created or modified in earlier statements.
    Furthermore, in version 1.2, the <code class="command">slonik</code> output
    includes a listing of each statement as it is processed, on the
    set origin node.  Similarly, the statements processed are listed
    in slon logs on the other nodes.</p>
<p> In <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> version 1.0, this would only lock the tables in
    the specified replication set.  As of 1.1, <span class="emphasis"><em>all
    replicated tables</em></span> are locked (<span class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span>
    - triggers are removed at the start, and restored at the end).
    This deals with the risk that one might request DDL changes on
    tables in multiple replication sets.</p>
