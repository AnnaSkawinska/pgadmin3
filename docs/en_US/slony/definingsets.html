<a name="definingsets"></a>7. Defining <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> Replication Sets</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Defining the nodes indicated the shape of the cluster of
database servers; it is now time to determine what data is to be
copied between them.  The groups of data that are copied are defined
as &#8220;<span class="quote">replication sets.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>A replication set consists of the following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Keys on tables that are to be replicated that have no
suitable primary key</p></li>
<li><p>Tables that are to be replicated</p></li>
<li><p>Sequences that are to be replicated</p></li>
</ul></div>

<a name="id514692"></a>7.1. Primary Keys</h3></div></div></div>
<p><span class="productname">Slony-I</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>needs</em></span> to have a primary key or
candidate thereof on each table that is replicated.  PK values are
used as the primary identifier for each tuple that is modified in the
source system.  There are three ways that you can get <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> to use
a primary key:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> If the table has a formally identified primary key,
<a href="stmtsetaddtable.html" title="SET ADD TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">SET ADD TABLE</span></a> can be used without any need to
reference the primary key.  <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> can automatically pick up that
there is a primary key, and use it.</p></li>
<li>
<p> If the table hasn't got a primary key, but has some
<span class="emphasis"><em>candidate</em></span> primary key, that is, some index on a
combination of fields that is both UNIQUE and NOT NULL, then you can
specify the key, as in</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SET ADD TABLE (set id = 1, origin = 1, id = 42, 
               full qualified name = 'public.this_table', 
               key = 'this_by_that', 
     comment='this_table has this_by_that as a candidate primary key');</pre>
<p> Notice that while you need to specify the namespace for the
table, you must <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> specify the namespace for the
key, as it infers the namespace from the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p> If the table hasn't even got a candidate primary key,
you can ask <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> to provide one.  This is done by first using
<a href="stmttableaddkey.html" title="TABLE ADD KEY"><span class="refentrytitle">TABLE ADD KEY</span></a> to add a column populated using a
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> sequence, and then having the <a href="stmtsetaddtable.html" title="SET ADD TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">SET ADD TABLE</span></a> include the directive
<code class="option">key=serial</code>, to indicate that <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>'s own column
should be used.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> It is not terribly important whether you pick a
&#8220;<span class="quote">true</span>&#8221; primary key or a mere &#8220;<span class="quote">candidate primary
key;</span>&#8221; it is, however, recommended that you have one of those
instead of having <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> populate the PK column for you.  If you
don't have a suitable primary key, that means that the table hasn't
got any mechanism from your application's standpoint for keeping
values unique.  <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> may therefore introduce a new failure mode
for your application, and this also implies that you had a way to
enter confusing data into the database.</p>

<a name="definesets"></a>7.2. Grouping tables into sets</h3></div></div></div>
<p> It will be vital to group tables together into a single set if
those tables are related via foreign key constraints.  If tables that
are thus related are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> replicated together,
you'll find yourself in trouble if you switch the &#8220;<span class="quote">master
provider</span>&#8221; from one node to another, and discover that the new
&#8220;<span class="quote">master</span>&#8221; can't be updated properly because it is missing
the contents of dependent tables.</p>
<p> There are also several reasons why you might
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> want to have all of the tables in one
replication set:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> The initial <code class="command">COPY_SET</code> event for a
large set leads to a <a href="faq.html#longtxnsareevil"> long running
transaction </a> on the provider node.  The <a href="faq.html">FAQ </a> outlines a number of problems that result from long
running transactions that will injure system performance.</p>
<p> If you can split such a large set into several smaller pieces,
that will shorten the length of each of the transactions, lessening
the degree of &#8220;<span class="quote">injury</span>&#8221; to performance.</p>
<p> These &#8220;<span class="quote">negative effects</span>&#8221; tend to emerge when the
database being subscribed to is tens of gigabytes in size.  For
relatively small databases, this shouldn't be a material factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Any time you invoke <a href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a>,
this requests a lock on <span class="emphasis"><em> every single table in the
replication set. </em></span></p>
<p> There have been reports &#8220;<span class="quote">in the field</span>&#8221; of this
leading to deadlocks such that the <a href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a>
request had to be submitted many times in order for it to actually
complete successfully.</p>
<p> The more tables you have in a set, the more tables need to be
locked, and the greater the chances of deadlocks. </p>
<p> By the same token, if a particular DDL script only needs to
affect a couple of tables, you might use <a href="stmtsetmovetable.html" title="SET MOVE
     TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">SET MOVE
     TABLE</span></a> to move them temporarily to a new
replication set.  By diminishing the number of locks needed, this
should ease the ability to get the DDL change into place.</p>

<a name="id514982"></a>7.3.  The Pathology of Sequences </h3></div></div></div>
<p> Each time a SYNC is processed, values are recorded for
<span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the sequences in the set.  If there are a
lot of sequences, this can cause <a href="table.sl-seqlog.html">sl_seqlog</a> to
grow rather large.</p>
<p> This points to an important difference between tables and
sequences: if you add additional tables that do not see much/any
activity, this does not add any material load to the work being done
by replication.  For a replicated sequence, values must
<span class="emphasis"><em>regularly</em></span> be propagated to subscribers.  Consider
the effects:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> A replicated table that is never updated does not
introduce much work to the system.</p>
<p> If it is not updated, the trigger on the table on the origin
never fires, and no entries are added to <a href="table.sl-log-1.html">sl_log_1</a>.  The table never appears in any of the
further replication queries (<span class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span> in the
<code class="command">FETCH 100 FROM LOG</code> queries used to find
replicatable data) as they only look for tables for which there are
entries in <a href="table.sl-log-1.html">sl_log_1</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In contrast, a fixed amount of work is introduced to
each SYNC by each sequence that is replicated.</p>
<p> Replicate 300 sequence and 300 rows need to be added to <a href="table.sl-seqlog.html">sl_seqlog</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<p> It is more than likely that if the value of a particular
sequence hasn't changed since it was last checked, perhaps the same
value need not be stored over and over; some thought needs to go into
how to do that safely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <a href="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/slony1/bugs/bugupdate.php?1226" target="_top">Bug #1226 </a> indicates an error condition that can come up if
you have a replication set that consists solely of sequences. </p>
<p> This is documented more in the <a href="faq.html#sequenceset"> FAQ
here;</a> the long and short is that having a replication set
consisting only of sequences is not a particularly good
idea.</p>
