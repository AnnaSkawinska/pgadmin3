Known issues
============

pgAdmin III
-----------

[DLG] Working with property dialog after the corresponding node is 
      refreshed crashes

[FRM] Editing very large columns freezes (might be restricted to bytea) the
      edit grid

wxWidgets
---------

[STC] ASSERT when typing a multibyte char [wx patch 1072408]

[GTK] Scrollbar doesn't scroll page by page in the browser tree.

[STC] Lexer doesn't know about escaping quotes

[GTK] FindFocus reports bogus controls. Symptom: select a menu or toolbar, 
      but nothing happens.

[GTK] combobox positioning when height is not specified; current workaround: 
      fixed 12d height

[GTK] Crash with some themes; probably gtk issue.

[MAC] wxComboBox::GetInsertionPoint() always returns 0 which prevents auto
      complete working correctly in combo boxes such as the data type 
      selectors. wxWidgets bug ref 1584384, applies to wx2.6.3 and 2.7.0.
        
[MAC] wxProcess::IsInputAvailable()/IsErrorAvailable() crash in wx2.7.0, 
      which prevents messages from pg_dump/pg_restore being displayed.
	    To avoid the crash, on Mac the streams aren't checked until the 
	    process ends. See ExternProcessDialog::Execute().
      wxWidgets bug ref 1584387.
        
[STC] On wxMSW 2.6.3 with Num Lock turned off, the control functions 
      (arrows, insert/delete etc) of the numeric keypad do not work.
      wxWidgets bug ref 1529525.
        
[AUI] If a pane with a minimum size set is docked next to the center pane, it
      is possible to drag either side such that the panes size is less than 
      the minimum. In addition, the minimum size doesn't appear to be honoured
      at all by the center pane. wxWidgets bug ref: 1578958
      
[MSW] In 2.7/2.7.1 on wxMSW, it seems that the return key is acting like tab 
      normally does in dialogues - ie. where the control doesn't catch the 
      keypress, the focus moves to the next control in the tab order. Default 
      buttons on the dialogue don't get activated. wxWidgets bug ref: 1582051.
      
[MAC] wxWindow::SetFont() is broken on wxMac - changing the applicaiton font 
      has no effect. wxWidgets bug ref: 1584926

[MAC] An About menu item is automatically added to frmQuery and frmEditGrid
      by wxWidgets(?). Currently this does nothing - add supporting code to
      display the About box?
      
[AUI] Managed windows (the main form, edit grid and query tool) are limited
      in size to the size of the primary display on a multihead system. 
      wxWidgets bug ref: 1600299
      
[FRM] Opening a modal dialogue from one query tool window blocks shortcut
      keys in another which is currently focused.

Known issues, that might stay unfixed

[FRM] MS Context menu key doesn't work in Windows (wxWidgets bug?).
