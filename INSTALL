Installing pgAdmin from source
==============================

This document describes how to build pgAdmin from source on *nix, Mac and 
Windows.

Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and other unix variants
-----------------------------------------------

You will need:

- A modern development environment: 

    - GTK 2.2 or above.
    - GNU automake 1.9 or above.
    - GNU autoconf 2.59 or above.
    - GNU gcc 3.4 or above.

- wxGTK 2.8.x from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
- libxml2 2.6.18 or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- libxslt 1.1.x or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- PostgreSQL 8.1 from http://www.postgresql.org/

Building:

1) Install libxml2 and libxslt if they are not already present on your system, 
   per the instructions included with them.
   
2) Install PostgreSQL per the instructions included. It is recommended that you
   build with OpenSSL support, using the --with-openssl configure option.
   
3) Unpack the wxGTK tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it
   as follows:
   
     cd /path/to/wxGTK/source/
     ./configure --with-gtk --enable-gtk2 --enable-unicode
     make
     sudo make install

     # Install wxWidgets contrib modules.
     cd contrib/
     make
     sudo make install
	
   A script is included in the pgAdmin source tarball 
   (xtra/wx-build/build-wxgtk) which will build and install wxWidgets in each 
   combination of shared/static/debug/release builds for you.
   
4) Unpack the pgAdmin tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it 
   as follows:
   
     sh bootstrap	# Required only if building from an SVN checkout
     ./configure
     make all
     sudo make install
	 
   If any of the prerequisite components are installed in locations that the 
   configure script cannot find, you may specify their locations on the command
   line. See the configure help (./configure --help) for details.
   
Mac OS X
--------

You will need:

- A modern development environment: 

    - XCode 2.0 or above
    - GNU automake 1.9 or above.
    - GNU autoconf 2.59 or above.

- wxMac 2.8.x from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
- libxml2 2.6.18 or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- libxslt 1.1.x or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- PostgreSQL 8.1 or above from http://www.postgresql.org/

Building:

1) Install libxml2 and libxslt per the instructions included with them into a 
   non-system location. The default versions included with OS X Panther and 
   Tiger are too old and will not work correctly with pgAdmin.
   
2) Install PostgreSQL per the instructions included. It is recommended that you
   build with OpenSSL support, using the --with-openssl configure option.
   
3) Unpack the wxMac tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it
   as follows:
   
     cd /path/to/wxMac/source/
     ./configure --with-mac --enable-gtk2 --enable-unicode
     make
     sudo make install

     # Install wxWidgets contrib modules.
     cd contrib/
     make
     sudo make install
	
   Note: You may also pass the --enable-universal_binary option to configure to
   build a Universal binary. This will also require a Universal build of 
   PostgreSQL's libpq library.
   
   A script is included in the pgAdmin source tarball 
   (xtra/wx-build/build-wxmac) which will install a Universal build ofwxWidgets 
   in each combination of shared/static/debug/release builds for you.
   
4) Unpack the pgAdmin tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it 
   as follows:
   
     sh bootstrap	# Required only if building from an SVN checkout
     ./configure --enable-appbundle
     make all
     make install
	 
   This final step will build an OSX appbundle called pgAdmin3.app in the root 
   of your source tree. As this can take a minute or two, the 
   pkg/mac/debug-bundle.sh script may be used to build a non-relocatable 'fake' 
   appbundle using symbolic links directly to the executable files. This 
   appbundle is called pgAdmin3-debug.app, and doesn't need to be rebuilt when 
   pgAdmin is recompiled.
   
   If any of the prerequisite components are installed in locations that the 
   configure script cannot find, you may specify their locations on the command
   line. See the configure help (./configure --help) for details.
   
Windows
-------

You will need:

- Windows 2000 or above.
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.
- The Windows 2003 R2 Platform SDK.
- wxMSW 2.8.x from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
- libxml2 2.6.18 or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- libxslt 1.1.x or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- iconv 1.9.x or above from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
- PostgreSQL 8.1 from http://www.postgresql.org/

Precompiled XML/XSLT and dependency packages for Windows can be found at 
http://zlatkovic.com. You probably need zlib 1.2.x as well as libxml2 and 
libxslt.

Building:

Note: All dependencies except for PostgreSQL must be installed under a 
      directory referred to as $BUILD_ROOT from here on. This can be located
      whereever you prefer.

1) Unpack the wxMSW source code $BUILD_ROOT/pgadmin3-deps/wxwidgets 
   
2) Install PostgreSQL to the default location using the community installer. 
   
3) Unpack the pgAdmin source code to $BUILD_ROOT/pgadmin3.

4) Copy the setup.h file from xtra/wx-build in the pgAdmin source tree to the 
   include/wx and include/wxmsw directories in the wxMSW source tree. Load
   the wxWidgets project in Visual Studio and batch build the libraries. To
   save time the "DLL" and "Universal" builds may be omitted. The ogl and stc
   contrib modules are also required.

5) Unpack the libxml2, libxslt and dependency binaries to 
   $BUILD_ROOT/pgadmin-deps/libxml2, $BUILD_ROOT/pgadmin-deps/libxslt etc.
   
6) Start Visual C++ and load the pgAdmin solution file. Build the required 
   targets.
